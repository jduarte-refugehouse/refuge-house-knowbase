# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## Trust-Based Relational Intervention (TBRI®) Implementation

### Through T3C Master Policy Framework

---

## OVERVIEW

Refuge House, Inc. has developed a comprehensive policy and procedure framework that establishes Trust-Based Relational Intervention (TBRI®) as the foundation for all T3C service delivery. Our approach utilizes a master T3C Basic Foster Family Home Support Services Policy (FC-T3C-01) and Procedure (FC-T3C-01.1) that serves as the central hub for TBRI implementation across all operational areas.

## MASTER POLICY FRAMEWORK

### Central Documents

- **FC-T3C-01**: T3C Basic Foster Family Home Support Services Policy  
- **FC-T3C-01.1**: T3C Basic Foster Family Home Support Services Procedure

These master documents:

1. Explicitly establish TBRI as our Evidence-informed Treatment Model  
2. Demonstrate how TBRI principles guide all service delivery  
3. Provide comprehensive cross-references to all related policies and procedures  
4. Ensure consistent TBRI implementation across all operational areas

### Policy Statement on TBRI

The master policy explicitly states that Refuge House has a policy that describes Trust-Based Relational Intervention (TBRI®) as the treatment/program model being utilized. This policy ensures that children, youth, and young adults are aware of TBRI and that all staff and caregivers providing these services are trained in, practice, and remain current with delivery of the treatment model.

### Cross-Reference Architecture

Our master policy framework systematically cross-references and integrates with:

#### **Assessment and Admission**

- **FC1-01.1**: Admission Screening Procedure

  - Coordinates medical care through trauma-informed lens  
  - Addresses sensory and regulation needs

#### **Transitions and Permanency**

- **FC14-01.1**: T3C Discharge and Permanency Planning Procedure  
  - Uses TBRI principles to support successful transitions  
  - Provides TBRI-based tools for receiving caregivers  
  - Maintains attachment focus throughout discharge process

#### **Alternative Care**

## TBRI PRACTITIONER CLARIFICATION

### Current TBRI Practitioner

**Michele Gorman**

- **Position:** Co-Founder and Executive Director  
- **Email:** [mgorman@refugehouse.org](mailto:mgorman@refugehouse.org)  
- **TBRI Certification:** Certified TBRI Practitioner since 2011

Michele Gorman is responsible for:

- The implementation of the TBRI plan at Refuge House  
- The ongoing development process of the treatment/program model

### Organizational Goal

The objective is to ensure that all staff at Refuge House with direct care responsibilities obtain TBRI practitioner status. We have experienced hurdles in this area due to TBRI practitioner trainings being booked solid into the future through the Karyn Purvis Institute.

## IMPLEMENTATION THROUGHOUT OPERATIONS

### Policy Level Integration

The master policy explicitly states:

"Refuge House will implement Trust-Based Relational Intervention (TBRI®) as its Evidence-informed Treatment Model for delivering the T3C Basic Foster Family Home Support Services Package. This Evidence-informed Treatment Model will be practiced throughout the operation and used as the basis to form all policy, procedures, and practices related to this Service Package."

### Procedure Level Implementation

The master procedure operationalizes TBRI through:

- **Daily Operations**: TBRI principles embedded in all routine activities  
- **Documentation**: TBRI strategies tracked in all case records  
- **Quality Assurance**: TBRI implementation fidelity monitored quarterly  
- **Training Requirements**: All staff and caregivers trained in TBRI  
- **Child Education**: Age-appropriate TBRI awareness materials

### Cross-Referenced Integration

Each related policy and procedure incorporates TBRI-specific elements:

- Assessment tools evaluate through TBRI lens  
- Service plans include TBRI-based interventions  
- Family engagement uses TBRI connecting strategies  
- Health services address trauma-related needs  
- Transitions maintain TBRI consistency

## EVIDENCE-INFORMED STATUS

Trust-Based Relational Intervention (TBRI®) is an evidence-informed treatment model with:

### California Evidence-Based Clearinghouse (CEBC) Rating

TBRI® has received a Scientific Rating of **3 \- Promising Research Evidence** from the California Evidence-Based Clearinghouse for Child Welfare (CEBC).

### How TBRI Supports Population Needs

TBRI is specifically designed for children who have experienced relational trauma, making it ideally suited for children in foster care. The evidence demonstrates effectiveness in reducing behavioral incidents, improving attachment behaviors, and enhancing placement stability.

## QUALITY ASSURANCE

Our Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) process specifically monitors:

- TBRI implementation fidelity across all service areas  
- Outcomes related to TBRI principles (attachment, regulation, behavioral incidents)  
- Staff and caregiver competency in TBRI application  
- Child progress through TBRI-informed metrics

### Fidelity Monitoring

The fidelity monitoring of TBRI implementation will be conducted through a cooperative effort between Michele Gorman and the Quality Assurance team.

## ADVANTAGES OF THIS FRAMEWORK

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: TBRI is not an add-on but the foundation of all services  
2. **Systematic Integration**: Cross-references ensure consistent implementation  
3. **Clear Accountability**: Each procedure identifies responsible parties for TBRI implementation  
4. **Measurable Outcomes**: CQI process tracks TBRI effectiveness  
5. **Regulatory Alignment**: Framework meets all T3C requirements while exceeding standards

## CONCLUSION

This master policy framework demonstrates Refuge House's commitment to TBRI as more than a treatment model—it is our organizational culture and the lens through which we view all aspects of care. Through systematic cross-referencing and integration, we ensure that every child, family, and caregiver experiences the healing power of trust-based relationships throughout their journey with us.
