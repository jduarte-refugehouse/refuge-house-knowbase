**Effective Date:** September 2025  
**Review Date:** Annual

---

## CURRICULUM OVERVIEW

### Training Structure

This modular curriculum provides crisis response training aligned with Trust-Based Relational Intervention (TBRI®) principles and T3C Blueprint requirements. Foster families complete the **Basic Crisis Response Training** (60 minutes) for T3C Basic Foster Family Home Support Services credential. Additional enhancement modules are completed only when pursuing Mental & Behavioral Health or IDD/Autism package credentials.

### Delivery Method

**Hybrid asynchronous format:**

- Self-paced video modules with embedded knowledge checks  
- Third-party video resources from TBRI® and crisis intervention experts  
- Interactive scenarios and decision-making exercises  
- Downloadable reference materials and quick guides  
- Competency assessment at completion

### Training Philosophy

All crisis response training integrates TBRI® principles while implementing **Satori Alternatives to Managing Aggression (SAMA)** as the authorized emergency behavior management program. This curriculum emphasizes prevention, de-escalation through the Assisting Process, and maintaining therapeutic relationships even during crisis situations. Physical restraint is always a last resort used only to prevent imminent harm.

- Recognizing early warning signs of dysregulation  
- Environmental modifications that prevent escalation  
- Routine and structure as crisis prevention

**Practical Strategies:**

  - Engagement activities before demands  
  - Attunement to child's emotional state  
  - Eye contact and voice tone awareness


- **Empowering Principles Applied:**  
    
  - Meeting physiological needs (hunger, thirst, rest, sensory)  
  - Offering appropriate choices  
  - Providing advance warnings for transitions  
  - Teaching coping skills during calm times

**Practice Activity:**

---

### Segment 3: De-escalation Techniques (15 minutes)

**Video Content (includes third-party crisis de-escalation video):**

- The de-escalation continuum: early to late intervention  
- Verbal de-escalation strategies  
- Environmental modifications during escalation  
- Co-regulation techniques  
- When and how to give space safely

**Refuge House procedure for responding to crisis situations:**

1. If a child is unwilling to speak to the foster parent, the alternate parent (if available) will attempt to engage the child in a verbal dialogue.  
2. If the child is unwilling to speak to either parent, the foster parent will contact the RH Case Manager or On-Call worker (if after regular business hours) in an effort to allow the child to speak with a third party who may be able to offer a more objective point of view.  
3. If the child refuses to speak with the RH Case Manager, and continues to escalate to the point that a foster parent believes he/she is becoming a danger to him/herself, families are instructed to contact their local police department for assistance.  
4. If, however, a child is in such an escalated state he/she is presenting an imminent risk of harm to him/herself or others, the foster parent may use one of two safe SAMA physical containments (Hug Containment or Elbow to Hip Containment) to manage a child's aggressive behavior until the child is calm and all others in the way of harm have been able to find a safe area such as another room in the home.

**The effective use of protective maneuvers if a child becomes aggressive:**

**Avoidant Techniques Policy:**

- Do no harm  
- Do not use pressure points or counter-aggression  
- Utilize avoidant techniques to create safe distance between self and child and to allow opportunity for verbal de-escalation

**Protective Actions:**

- Protection from a distance  
- Avoiding strikes, kicks, and pushes  
- Protection from wrist grasps  
- Protection from life-threatening aggression

- Approved SAMA restraint techniques for Refuge House  
- Individual Crisis Management Plans (ICMP)  
- Prohibited restraint and discipline methods  
- Medical monitoring requirements during and after restraint

**Understanding Your Child's ICMP:** Each child has an Individual Crisis Management Plan that:

- Identifies history of high-risk behaviors and triggers  
- Documents effectiveness of previous interventions  
- Lists psychological, social, and medical factors affecting crisis response  
- Specifies helpful de-escalation strategies  
- Identifies interventions that may NOT work due to trauma history

  - Protecting child from external danger causing imminent significant risk (e.g., running into street, touching hot stove)  
  - Must end **immediately** after danger is averted  
  - Intervening when child over 5 years old demonstrates disruptive behavior creating safety risk when other measures have failed  
- **Duration:** Maximum one (1) minute only  
- **Release criteria:** Must end immediately once danger is averted or one minute passes  
- **Documentation:** Required for all instances

**2\. Personal Restraint (Hug Containment or Elbow-to-Hip Containment):**

- **Authorized use ONLY when:**

  - Used only as absolute last resort after all less restrictive interventions exhausted  
  - Child's service plan may specify this intervention is approved for protection  
- **Maximum duration:** 15 minutes for all children  
- **Monitoring requirements:**  
  - Continuous visual monitoring of child's face throughout restraint  
  - Monitor mental status, breathing, respiration continuously  
  - Ensure child can communicate throughout (verbal children must be able to speak; non-verbal children must have alternative communication method)  
  - Re-explain release criteria every 15 minutes if child doesn't understand  
- **Release criteria:**  
  - Child no longer poses danger to self or others  
  - Any signs of physical distress require immediate release and emergency medical care  
  - Maximum 15 minutes reached  
- **Nutritional/hydration needs:** Child must have opportunity to use bathroom when necessary, safe, and appropriate

**PROHIBITED Use of Any Personal Restraints:**

- As punishment  
- For retribution or retaliation

- Foster parents must be SAMA-trained before using personal restraint  
- Immediate goal is to transition to programmatic intervention (cooling off, teaching self-control, problem-solving)  
- Child observed for minimum 15 minutes after restraint ends to ensure safety  
- If child refuses medication ordered by physician, take to emergency room rather than restrain

**Practice Activity:**
