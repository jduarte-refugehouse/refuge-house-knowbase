## PURPOSE

This procedure operationalizes Policy HT-POL-001 by establishing specific procedures for implementing Universal Human Trafficking Prevention Training requirements across all T3C Service Packages at Refuge House. While the Universal Human Trafficking Prevention Training Policy (HT-POL-001) establishes the foundational principles and the 'what and why' of human trafficking prevention, this procedure document provides the specific 'who, when, where, and how' of implementation, which may be adapted as necessary to respond to regulatory changes, technological advancements, or operational improvements.

While the Universal Human Trafficking Prevention Training Policy (HT-POL-001) establishes Refuge House's core principles, philosophy, and commitments regarding human trafficking prevention education, this procedure document provides the detailed operational steps to implement those policy commitments. Policies require Board approval and establish organizational values and intentions, while procedures specify the detailed implementation steps that may be modified by the Executive Director to adapt to changing regulatory requirements, technological advancements, or operational improvements without Board approval, provided such changes maintain alignment with the policy's core intent. This procedure document will be reviewed at least annually and updated as needed to reflect changes in regulatory requirements or internal operational improvements identified through the continuous quality improvement process.

## PROCEDURE

### 1\. TRAINING MODEL SELECTION AND APPROVAL

#### Purpose and Overview

The foundation of Refuge House's human trafficking prevention efforts begins with selecting an appropriate training model that meets T3C Blueprint requirements while serving our specific population needs. The T3C System provides flexibility in choosing between the DFPS-developed Universal Human Trafficking Prevention Training or an alternative evidence-based curriculum. This section outlines Refuge House's approach to training model selection, which initially adopts the DFPS curriculum while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.

The DFPS Universal Human Trafficking Prevention Training: A Foundation for Texas Residential Providers and Caregivers was developed in Fall 2024 specifically to meet T3C requirements. This curriculum incorporates trauma-informed principles consistent with TBRI® by emphasizing relationship-building, recognizing trauma responses, and empowering children through education. The 3-hour Train-the-Trainer course is available through self-enrollment on the DFPS LearningHUB, making it accessible and cost-effective for our organization.

### 3\. STAFF AND CAREGIVER TRAINING IMPLEMENTATION

#### Purpose and Overview

The T3C Blueprint mandates universal training for all staff and caregivers, recognizing their unique position to intervene and educate vulnerable populations. This comprehensive training requirement ensures every adult in contact with children possesses baseline knowledge for protection and prevention. The DFPS curriculum addresses the complexities of human trafficking while emphasizing how child welfare involvement creates specific vulnerabilities.

Implementation of this training reflects Refuge House's commitment to creating multiple layers of protection for children. By ensuring all staff and caregivers understand trafficking dynamics, recognize warning signs, and know how to respond appropriately, we create an environment where children are surrounded by knowledgeable, vigilant adults who can both protect them and provide prevention education.

### 5\. CHILD/YOUTH PREVENTION EDUCATION PLANNING

#### Purpose and Overview

The T3C Blueprint mandates that "relevant information provided in the Universal Human Trafficking Prevention Training be shared with children, youth, and young adults being served by the provider." However, it provides flexibility in delivery methods, recognizing that children's diverse experiences, developmental stages, and trauma histories require individualized approaches. This section establishes Refuge House's systematic approach to planning prevention education that is both comprehensive and sensitive to each child's needs.

The DFPS curriculum includes practical, age-appropriate strategies for primary prevention that align with TBRI®'s empowerment principles. By providing children with knowledge about healthy relationships, personal boundaries, and safety awareness, we empower them to recognize potentially unsafe situations. This education occurs within the context of trusting relationships, using developmentally attuned communication that respects each child's readiness to receive information.

| Program Director | 5.6 Establish written protocol for expanding prevention education resources as new evidence-based materials become available, while maintaining DFPS curriculum as foundation | Within 120 days of policy adoption | Program enhancement plan | Continuous improvement |

### 6\. CHILD/YOUTH PREVENTION EDUCATION DELIVERY

#### Purpose and Overview

Effective delivery of prevention education requires balancing regulatory compliance with trauma-informed, developmentally appropriate practices. The T3C Blueprint's flexibility in delivery methods allows Refuge House to meet each child where they are, using approaches that feel safe and supportive rather than frightening or overwhelming. This section operationalizes the various approved delivery methods while maintaining focus on building resilience and protective factors.

Implementation of prevention education reflects TBRI®'s correcting principles by teaching protective behaviors within the context of safe, trusting relationships. Recognizing that children who have experienced trauma may need repeated, gentle education delivered by trusted caregivers in moments of felt safety, our approach emphasizes relationship over compliance, understanding that effective prevention education cannot occur without a foundation of trust.
