## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**15 BUSINESS DAY DEADLINE**: All Enhanced Continued Stay Confirmations for specialized packages MUST be submitted to SSCC/DFPS within 15 business days of review. Missing this deadline is a compliance violation.

**BOTH SIGNATURES REQUIRED**: For Mental Health, IDD/Autism, Substance Use, and Treatment Foster Family Care packages, the Enhanced Continued Stay Confirmation Form requires BOTH Program Director AND Treatment Director signatures. One signature alone is insufficient.

**60-DAY CYCLE FOR TFFC**: Treatment Foster Family Care uses a 60-day review cycle, NOT the 90-day cycle used by other specialized packages.

**NO CONTINUED STAY FOR STASS**: Short-Term Assessment Support Services does NOT require continued stay reviews - it is time-limited with assessment transition, not ongoing placement.

**CLINICAL JUSTIFICATION**: Generic statements are insufficient. Specific, measurable clinical indicators must support continued stay determinations.

*This procedure document operationalizes FC-CSR-01 Continued Stay Review Policy. Procedures may be updated by the Executive Director to adapt to regulatory changes or operational improvements without requiring Board approval, provided changes maintain alignment with policy intent.*
