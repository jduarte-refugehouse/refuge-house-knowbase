## PROCEDURE:

### 1\. FAMILY CONNECTIONS IDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT

#### Purpose and Overview

As stated in Refuge House's Family Connections and Engagement Policy (FC7-01), "Refuge House is committed to implementing a family engagement approach that proactively identifies, outreaches to, and collaborates with the child's biological parents, siblings, relatives, potential kinship caregivers, and other supportive persons throughout the child's placement." This procedure outlines the specific steps required to fulfill this policy commitment.

Research consistently demonstrates that maintaining healthy connections with family members and other supportive persons improves placement stability, enhances emotional well-being, and increases the likelihood of successful permanency outcomes. Family connections identification is not a one-time event but rather an ongoing process that begins at admission and continues throughout placement. Using a trauma-informed lens aligned with our TBRI model, Refuge House staff methodically identify and assess the nature, quality, and potential impact of each relationship in a child's life.

The identification process must be culturally sensitive, recognizing that family structures and supportive relationships may vary significantly across different cultural backgrounds. Staff must approach this work with humility and openness, allowing children and families to define their own support networks while ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.
