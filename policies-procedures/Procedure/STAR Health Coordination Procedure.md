## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:

This procedure specifically addresses coordination with STAR Health to fulfill T3C requirements. The T3C Blueprint emphasizes cross-system coordination with STAR Health as a critical component for meeting service package requirements. During the transition period (2025-2027), all requirements in this procedure apply to children in both legacy Service Levels and T3C Packages, with additional T3C-specific requirements clearly marked.

## PROCEDURE:

### 1\. STAR HEALTH ENROLLMENT AND BENEFITS COORDINATION

#### Purpose and Overview

STAR Health enrollment and benefits coordination establishes the foundation for all health services that children in foster care will receive during their placement. Our policy emphasizes that "Refuge House will coordinate with STAR Health, medical professionals, and other service providers to ensure that children receive appropriate preventive care, screenings, evaluations, and treatment for identified physical and mental health needs." This coordination begins with ensuring proper enrollment and understanding of available benefits.

STAR Health is the comprehensive managed care program specifically designed for children in foster care, providing medical, dental, vision, behavioral health, and pharmacy services through a coordinated network of providers. Every child in DFPS conservatorship and young adults in Extended Foster Care are automatically enrolled, but verification of enrollment and benefits is essential for ensuring immediate access to services.

The T3C model emphasizes the importance of coordinated care and outcome-focused services. STAR Health coordination supports these goals by providing a single point of contact for health services and ensuring that all of a child's health needs are addressed through an integrated approach that supports their overall well-being and progress toward permanency goals.

### 2\. PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER SELECTION AND MANAGEMENT

#### Purpose and Overview

Primary care provider selection and management ensures that every child has an established medical home through the STAR Health network that can provide comprehensive, coordinated medical care. The policy recognizes that "Foster parents will be actively engaged in the health care process, receiving training, guidance, and support to meet each child's specific health needs," and PCP selection is a crucial area where this engagement begins.

The medical home concept is central to quality healthcare for children, providing a consistent source of care that coordinates all health services and maintains comprehensive health records. For children in foster care who may have experienced disrupted healthcare, establishing a strong relationship with a primary care provider is essential for building trust and ensuring continuity of care.

The T3C model emphasizes the importance of minimizing disruptions in services that children value, and maintaining existing provider relationships when possible supports this goal while ensuring that children continue to receive high-quality care that meets their individual needs.

### 3\. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES COORDINATION

#### Purpose and Overview

Behavioral health services coordination ensures that children receive appropriate mental health and substance abuse services through the STAR Health network in accordance with their individual needs and T3C package requirements. Our policy acknowledges that "physical and mental health care are interconnected and essential components of trauma-informed care" and emphasizes coordinated approaches to address comprehensive health needs.

The T3C model places significant emphasis on trauma-informed, evidence-based behavioral health services that are tailored to each child's specific needs and circumstances. For children in specialized behavioral health packages, these services become the primary focus of their treatment, while for children in basic foster care, behavioral health services provide essential support for healing and healthy development.

Coordination of behavioral health services requires careful attention to provider qualifications, treatment approaches, and integration with other services to ensure that all components of a child's care work together to support their healing and development rather than creating confusion or conflicting approaches.

### 4\. STAR HEALTH SERVICE COORDINATION FOR COMPLEX NEEDS

#### Purpose and Overview

STAR Health Service Coordination is a specialized service designed for children with complex medical, behavioral, or developmental needs that require enhanced coordination and support. Our policy establishes that "Refuge House will coordinate with STAR Health, medical professionals, and other service providers" to ensure comprehensive care, and Service Coordination represents the most intensive level of this coordination for children with the greatest needs.

Service Coordination provides dedicated support from a STAR Health Service Coordinator who works specifically with children and families to navigate complex health systems, coordinate multiple providers, and ensure that all health needs are addressed in a timely and effective manner. This service is particularly important for children in specialized T3C packages where health needs may be central to their placement and treatment goals.

The T3C model emphasizes outcome-focused, coordinated care that addresses the comprehensive needs of children and families. Service Coordination supports these goals by providing a single point of contact for complex health coordination and ensuring that all services work together to achieve positive outcomes for children.

### 5\. MANAGING SERVICE DENIALS AND ACCESS BARRIERS

#### Purpose and Overview

Managing service denials and access barriers ensures that children receive necessary health services even when initial requests are denied or when barriers to access exist within the STAR Health system. The policy emphasizes that health services should be provided "in accordance with regulatory requirements, STAR Health protocols, and trauma-informed practices," and this includes advocating for children when initial access attempts are unsuccessful.

Service denials can occur for various reasons including lack of prior authorization, questions about medical necessity, or administrative errors. Regardless of the reason for denial, children's health needs must be addressed promptly, and case managers must be prepared to advocate effectively for necessary services while following appropriate appeal processes.

The T3C model emphasizes that services should be individualized to meet each child's specific needs, and this sometimes requires persistence and creativity in working with managed care systems to ensure that children receive appropriate care that supports their safety, permanency, and well-being goals.

### 6\. T3C DOCUMENTATION AND COMPLIANCE MONITORING

#### Purpose and Overview

T3C documentation and compliance monitoring ensures that all STAR Health coordination activities are properly documented to demonstrate compliance with T3C service package requirements and to support continuous quality improvement efforts. The policy establishes that "All services will be documented and tracked to ensure continuity of care and compliance with regulatory requirements," and STAR Health coordination is a critical component of this documentation.

The T3C model emphasizes outcome-focused service delivery and requires specific documentation that demonstrates how services support the Evidence-informed Treatment Model and contribute to positive outcomes for children. This documentation serves multiple purposes including regulatory compliance, quality assurance, outcome measurement, and continuous improvement of service coordination practices.

Effective documentation also supports transparency and accountability in service delivery, enabling supervisors, auditors, and oversight bodies to verify that children are receiving appropriate services and that coordination efforts are effective in supporting their needs and goals.

### 7\. FOSTER PARENT AND CAREGIVER TRAINING

#### Purpose and Overview

Foster parent and caregiver training ensures that caregivers have the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively navigate the STAR Health system and support children's health needs. The policy emphasizes that "Foster parents will be actively engaged in the health care process, receiving training, guidance, and support to meet each child's specific health needs," and STAR Health coordination training is essential for this engagement.

Foster parents and caregivers serve as the primary advocates for children's daily health needs and are often the first to identify health concerns or changes in health status. Effective training helps them understand their role in the STAR Health system, know how to access services, and feel confident in supporting children through health care experiences.

The trauma-informed approach recognizes that foster parents need support and training to help children navigate health care systems that may trigger anxiety or trauma responses. Training helps caregivers understand how to provide emotional support and create positive health care experiences for children in their care.
