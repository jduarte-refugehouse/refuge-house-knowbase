## PROCEDURE

### 1. STAR HEALTH ENROLLMENT AND BENEFITS COORDINATION

#### Purpose and Overview

STAR Health enrollment and benefits coordination establishes the foundation for all health services that children in foster care will receive during their placement. Our policy emphasizes that "Refuge House will coordinate with STAR Health, medical professionals, and other service providers to ensure that children receive appropriate preventive care, screenings, evaluations, and treatment for identified physical and mental health needs." This coordination begins with ensuring proper enrollment and understanding of available benefits.

STAR Health is the comprehensive managed care program specifically designed for children in foster care, providing medical, dental, vision, behavioral health, and pharmacy services through a coordinated network of providers. Every child in DFPS conservatorship and young adults in Extended Foster Care are automatically enrolled, but verification of enrollment and benefits is essential for ensuring immediate access to services.

The T3C model emphasizes the importance of coordinated care and outcome-focused services. STAR Health coordination supports these goals by providing a single point of contact for health services and ensuring that all of a child's health needs are addressed through an integrated approach that supports their overall well-being and progress toward permanency goals.

### 2. PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER SELECTION AND MANAGEMENT

#### Purpose and Overview

Primary care provider selection and management ensures that every child has an established medical home through the STAR Health network that can provide comprehensive, coordinated medical care. The policy recognizes that "Foster parents will be actively engaged in the health care process, receiving training, guidance, and support to meet each child's specific health needs," and PCP selection is a crucial area where this engagement begins.

The medical home concept is central to quality healthcare for children, providing a consistent source of care that coordinates all health services and maintains comprehensive health records. For children in foster care who may have experienced disrupted healthcare, establishing a strong relationship with a primary care provider is essential for building trust and ensuring continuity of care.

The T3C model emphasizes the importance of minimizing disruptions in services that children value, and maintaining existing provider relationships when possible supports this goal while ensuring that children continue to receive high-quality care that meets their individual needs.

### 10. FOSTER PARENT AND CAREGIVER TRAINING

#### Purpose and Overview

Foster parent and caregiver training ensures that caregivers have the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively navigate the STAR Health system and support children's health needs. The policy emphasizes that "Foster parents will be actively engaged in the health care process, receiving training, guidance, and support to meet each child's specific health needs," and STAR Health coordination training is essential for this engagement.

Foster parents and caregivers serve as the primary advocates for children's daily health needs and are often the first to identify health concerns or changes in health status. Effective training helps them understand their role in the STAR Health system, know how to access services, and feel confident in supporting children through health care experiences.

The trauma-informed approach recognizes that foster parents need support and training to help children navigate health care systems that may trigger anxiety or trauma responses. Training helps caregivers understand how to provide emotional support and create positive health care experiences for children in their care.
