## RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLICY AND PROCEDURE:

This procedure operationalizes the Physical and Mental Health Care Policy (FC10-01) by providing specific implementation steps for ensuring comprehensive health care coordination. While the policy establishes that "Refuge House is committed to ensuring that all children, youth, and young adults in care receive comprehensive physical, dental, vision, and mental health services," this procedure details the specific actions, timeframes, and documentation requirements needed to fulfill that commitment in compliance with regulatory standards and T3C Package requirements.

## RESPONSIBILITY:

- Case Managers  
- Program Directors/LCPAAs  
- Treatment Directors  
- Home Developers  
- Intake Department  
- Foster Parents  
- Quality Assurance

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:

This procedure addresses health care requirements across both Minimum Standards and T3C Service Packages. During the transition period (2025-2027), children in care may be served under either the legacy Service Level system (Basic, Moderate, Specialized) or the new T3C Package system. This procedure document identifies:

- **Minimum Standards Requirements**: Core requirements that apply to ALL children regardless of Service Level or T3C Package (identified as "Core Requirements")  
- **Legacy Service Level Requirements**: Specific requirements based on Basic, Moderate, or Specialized Service Levels (identified where applicable during the transition period)  
- **T3C Package-Specific Requirements**: Enhanced requirements that apply only to specific T3C Packages (clearly marked with package names)

Case Managers should identify which system applies to each child and follow the appropriate requirements accordingly. When a child transitions from Service Levels to a T3C Package, the T3C Package requirements will supersede the legacy Service Level requirements.

## PROCEDURE:

### 1\. INITIAL HEALTH COORDINATION

#### Purpose and Overview

The initial health coordination process ensures that every child entering Refuge House care receives immediate attention to their health needs and establishes the foundation for ongoing health care management. Our policy emphasizes that "Refuge House recognizes the critical importance of addressing each child's comprehensive health needs as part of promoting their overall well-being and development." This initial coordination sets the stage for achieving that comprehensive approach.

The first days of placement are critical for health coordination because children may arrive with immediate medical needs, unclear health histories, or anxiety about medical care due to past trauma. The policy states that "All health care services will be implemented with consideration of each child's trauma history and individual needs, ensuring that services are provided in a manner that promotes safety, healing, and healthy development." This procedure section provides the specific steps needed to gather essential health information, verify insurance coverage, and prepare both the child and foster family for ongoing health care coordination.

Effective initial health coordination also supports the T3C model's emphasis on comprehensive assessment and individualized service planning. By systematically gathering health information and coordinating with STAR Health from the beginning, we create the foundation for health services that are tailored to each child's specific needs and integrated with their overall service plan.

### 2\. MEDICAL CARE COORDINATION

#### Purpose and Overview

Medical care coordination ensures that every child receives timely, appropriate medical examinations and treatment in accordance with Texas Health Steps requirements and T3C standards. The policy establishes that "Refuge House will coordinate with STAR Health, medical professionals, and other service providers to ensure that children receive appropriate preventive care, screenings, evaluations, and treatment for identified physical and mental health needs." This coordination is essential for maintaining children's health and supporting their overall development.

The Texas Health Steps program provides comprehensive medical services for children in foster care, and compliance with Texas Health Steps requirements is not only a regulatory mandate but also a critical component of quality care. Children in foster care often have complex health needs due to their histories of trauma, neglect, or inadequate medical care prior to placement. Our systematic approach to medical coordination ensures that these needs are identified and addressed promptly.

For children in specialized T3C packages, medical coordination takes on additional importance as health needs may be directly related to the reasons for their specialized placement. The procedure steps below ensure that all children receive appropriate medical care while those in specialized packages receive the enhanced coordination their conditions require.

| Who | How | When | Where | Regulatory Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |

### 3\. DENTAL CARE COORDINATION

#### Purpose and Overview

Dental care coordination ensures that children receive appropriate preventive and treatment dental services according to Texas Health Steps requirements. Many children entering foster care have significant dental needs due to neglect or lack of access to dental care in their previous living situations. Our policy recognizes that comprehensive health care includes dental health, and establishing good dental care patterns supports both immediate health needs and long-term wellness.

The timing requirements for dental examinations are specifically designed to identify urgent dental problems quickly while ensuring that all children receive comprehensive dental assessments within reasonable timeframes. For very young children, the timing of initial dental visits is tied to the emergence of teeth and the child's developmental readiness for dental care.

Regular dental care not only addresses immediate problems but also establishes positive dental health habits that children can carry into adulthood. Through coordination with STAR Health dental providers and support for foster parents, we ensure that dental care becomes a normal, non-threatening part of each child's health care routine.

### 4\. VISION AND HEARING SCREENING

#### Purpose and Overview

Vision and hearing screening is essential for identifying potential problems that could significantly impact a child's development, learning, and overall quality of life. Many children in foster care have not received regular vision and hearing screenings, and unidentified problems in these areas can contribute to behavioral challenges, academic difficulties, and social problems that may be misattributed to trauma or other factors.

Early identification of vision and hearing problems allows for prompt intervention, which can dramatically improve outcomes for children. The policy emphasizes the importance of comprehensive health assessments, and vision and hearing screening are critical components of this comprehensive approach. These screenings are typically integrated into regular medical checkups but may require specialized follow-up if problems are identified.

The trauma-informed approach is particularly important for vision and hearing screening because the procedures can be anxiety-provoking for children who have experienced medical trauma or who have sensory sensitivities related to their trauma history.

Ensure ongoing monitoring per Texas Health Steps schedule | **Within 5 days of receiving results** | Radius and Service Plan documentation | TAC §749.1407; Service planning integration |

### 5\. IMMUNIZATION MANAGEMENT

#### Purpose and Overview

Immunization management ensures that children receive all required immunizations according to CDC recommendations and state requirements while maintaining accurate records that comply with regulatory standards. Children entering foster care may have incomplete immunization records or may be behind on recommended immunizations, making this a critical area for immediate attention and ongoing monitoring.

The immunization process requires careful coordination between reviewing existing records, identifying needed immunizations, and ensuring timely administration of vaccines. This process must be completed quickly to protect the child's health and ensure compliance with school and program requirements. Documentation of immunizations must meet specific regulatory standards and be readily accessible for various purposes including school enrollment and medical care.

The trauma-informed approach to immunizations recognizes that medical procedures can be particularly challenging for children who have experienced trauma, and the process should be designed to minimize anxiety and build positive associations with medical care.

### 6\. MENTAL HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES

#### Purpose and Overview

Mental health and developmental services address the complex psychological and developmental needs of children who have experienced trauma, loss, and disruption in their lives. Our policy acknowledges that "physical and mental health care are interconnected and essential components of trauma-informed care" and emphasizes that "All health care services will be implemented with consideration of each child's trauma history and individual needs."

The T3C model places significant emphasis on trauma-informed care and evidence-based treatment approaches. For children in specialized mental health packages, these services become the primary focus of their care coordination. For children in basic foster care, mental health services provide essential support for healing and healthy development. Early identification of developmental concerns through ECI services for young children ensures that interventions begin as early as possible when they are most effective.

The integration of psychological evaluations, therapy services, and specialized interventions must be carefully coordinated to ensure that all services work together to support the child's healing and development rather than creating additional stress or confusion.

### 7\. THERAPY SERVICES COORDINATION

#### Purpose and Overview

Therapy services coordination ensures that children receive appropriate therapeutic interventions based on their individual needs and service package requirements. The policy states that "Foster parents will be actively engaged in the health care process, receiving training, guidance, and support to meet each child's specific health needs," and therapy coordination is a critical area where this engagement is essential for success.

During the transition period, therapy requirements vary significantly between the legacy Service Level system and the new T3C packages. Case managers must clearly understand which system applies to each child and ensure that therapy services meet the appropriate standards. The frequency and intensity of therapy services are carefully calibrated to match the child's needs and the service expectations of their assigned package.

Coordination with therapists involves more than simply scheduling appointments; it requires ongoing communication about treatment progress, integration of therapeutic recommendations into daily care, and regular review of treatment effectiveness. This coordination supports the T3C model's emphasis on evidence-informed treatment and outcome measurement.

### 8\. MEDICATION MANAGEMENT

#### Purpose and Overview

Medication management ensures the safe administration and monitoring of all medications prescribed for children in care while maintaining accurate documentation that meets regulatory requirements. The policy emphasizes that "All services will be documented and tracked to ensure continuity of care and compliance with regulatory requirements," and medication management is a critical area where documentation accuracy directly impacts child safety.

Medication management involves coordination between prescribing physicians, pharmacies, foster parents, and case management staff to ensure that children receive medications as prescribed while monitoring for effectiveness and side effects. For children receiving psychotropic medications, additional oversight and monitoring requirements apply to ensure appropriate use and to comply with DFPS psychotropic medication guidelines.

The trauma-informed approach to medication management recognizes that some children may have negative associations with taking medications due to past experiences, and the process should be designed to build trust and understanding rather than creating additional anxiety or resistance.

### 9\. PACKAGE-SPECIFIC HEALTH REQUIREMENTS

#### Purpose and Overview

Package-specific health requirements ensure that children in specialized T3C packages receive the enhanced health coordination and services that their conditions require. While all children receive comprehensive health care, those in specialized packages have additional needs that require more intensive coordination, specialized providers, or enhanced monitoring.

The T3C model recognizes that children with complex medical needs, behavioral health challenges, or developmental disabilities require individualized approaches that go beyond standard foster care health services. These package-specific requirements ensure that health services are tailored to support the specific goals and outcomes expected for each specialized package.

Implementation of package-specific requirements requires close coordination between case management, clinical staff, specialized providers, and STAR Health service coordination to ensure that all components of the child's health care work together to support their specialized needs.

### 10\. DOCUMENTATION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE

#### Purpose and Overview

Documentation and quality assurance processes ensure that all health coordination activities are properly recorded, monitored, and evaluated for effectiveness and compliance. Our policy emphasizes that "Refuge House will maintain appropriate documentation of all health-related services, appointments, and treatments in accordance with regulatory requirements and best practices for child welfare."

The documentation requirements serve multiple purposes: they ensure regulatory compliance, support continuity of care when staff changes occur, provide evidence of appropriate services for auditing purposes, and create a comprehensive health history that follows the child throughout their placement and beyond. Quality assurance processes help identify areas for improvement and ensure that documentation standards are consistently maintained.

The integration of health documentation with the overall Service Plan and T3C Implementation Tool ensures that health services are not viewed in isolation but as integral components of the child's comprehensive care plan that supports their safety, permanency, and well-being.
