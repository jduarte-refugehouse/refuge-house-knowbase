### 1\. INITIAL SCREENING EVALUATION

**Purpose and Overview**

The initial screening process serves as the critical first step in ensuring children are matched with appropriate foster homes that can meet their needs. As our policy states, "Refuge House evaluates all children and youth referrals immediately upon receipt to determine appropriateness for services and placement." This immediate response is particularly crucial for emergency placements where children need safe placement without delay. The screening criteria ensure we can provide appropriate care within our T3C Basic Foster Family Home service package while maintaining compliance with all regulatory requirements.

### 2\. DETAILED ASSESSMENT AND MATCHING

**Purpose and Overview**

Once initial criteria are met, the detailed assessment begins to ensure the best possible match between child and foster family. This stage incorporates our commitment to trauma-informed care by gathering comprehensive information about the child's history, needs, and strengths. The information collected here directly impacts placement success, as matching a child with the right foster family from the beginning is one of the most effective ways to minimize trauma and promote healing. Special attention is given to children who have experienced multiple placements, recognizing that these children require additional support and careful matching.

### 3\. PLACEMENT MATCHING PROCESS

**Purpose and Overview**

The placement matching process represents the crucial link between understanding a child's needs and finding the right foster family to meet those needs. Our policy emphasizes that "Refuge House completes a thorough foster home screening and verification process prior to any family home becoming licensed," ensuring we have detailed knowledge of each family's strengths and capabilities. This knowledge, combined with the child's assessment information, allows us to make informed matches that support placement stability and child well-being. Special consideration is given to maintaining sibling connections, cultural identity, and community ties whenever possible.
