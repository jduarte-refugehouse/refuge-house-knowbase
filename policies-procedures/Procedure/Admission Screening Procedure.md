## PROCEDURE:

### 1. INITIAL SCREENING EVALUATION

**Purpose and Overview**

The initial screening process serves as the critical first step in ensuring children are matched with appropriate foster homes that can meet their needs. As our policy states, "Refuge House evaluates all children and youth referrals immediately upon receipt to determine appropriateness for services and placement." This immediate response is particularly crucial for emergency placements where children need safe placement without delay. The screening criteria ensure we can provide appropriate care within our credentialed T3C Service Packages while maintaining compliance with all regulatory requirements.

### 2. DETAILED ASSESSMENT AND MATCHING

**Purpose and Overview**

Once initial criteria are met, the detailed assessment begins to ensure the best possible match between child and foster family. This stage incorporates our commitment to trauma-informed care by gathering comprehensive information about the child's history, needs, and strengths. The information collected here directly impacts placement success, as matching a child with the right foster family from the beginning is one of the most effective ways to minimize trauma and promote healing. Special attention is given to children who have experienced multiple placements, recognizing that these children require additional support and careful matching.
