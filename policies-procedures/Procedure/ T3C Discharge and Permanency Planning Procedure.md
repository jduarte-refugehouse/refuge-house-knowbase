## PROCEDURE:

### 1\. PERMANENCY PLANNING IMPLEMENTATION

#### Purpose and Overview

Permanency planning represents a fundamental responsibility in child welfare, as every child deserves a permanent, safe, and nurturing home. The T3C Discharge and Permanency Planning Policy emphasizes that "Permanency Planning begins at admission and is incorporated into every service plan, with specific goals and action steps designed to support the child's permanency outcome."

Research consistently demonstrates that children who achieve timely permanency experience better long-term outcomes in mental health, educational achievement, and social functioning. The procedures outlined below ensure that permanency planning remains central to our work from the moment a child enters care through their successful transition to a permanent living situation.

These procedures align with TAC §749.1309 which requires that service plans address permanency goals and the T3C Blueprint's emphasis on outcome-focused service delivery. By implementing these systematic approaches to permanency planning, we create clear pathways toward achieving each child's permanency goals while ensuring all regulatory requirements are met.

### 2\. CONTINUED STAY EVALUATIONS

#### Purpose and Overview

Regular evaluation of continued placement need ensures children receive appropriate levels of care without unnecessary restriction. These evaluations balance the child's need for specialized services with the principle of least restrictive environment, ensuring children don't remain in intensive placements longer than clinically necessary.

The T3C system establishes expected lengths of stay for each Service Package, recognizing that some children may need extended services while others may be ready for step-down sooner than anticipated. These procedures ensure systematic review of continued stay need while meeting all regulatory requirements.

### 3\. PLANNED DISCHARGE PROCESS

#### Purpose and Overview

Successful discharge planning transforms policy commitments into concrete actions that support children's transitions to permanency. Our policy states that "discharge planning is conducted in accordance with TBRI principles to support felt safety during transitions," recognizing that how we manage transitions significantly impacts children's ability to form new attachments and thrive in their permanent placements.

The planned discharge process begins as soon as a discharge date is known or when service plan reviews indicate readiness for transition. This proactive approach allows adequate time for preparation, reducing anxiety and increasing the likelihood of placement stability. The procedures below ensure comprehensive planning that addresses all aspects of the child's life while maintaining trauma-informed practices throughout the transition.

These procedures address the HIGH-WEIGHT STANDARD in TAC §749.1361 requiring discharge planning for all children. By following these systematic steps, we ensure regulatory compliance while prioritizing the child's emotional well-being during this critical transition period.

### 4\. DISCHARGE DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDS

#### Purpose and Overview

Comprehensive documentation during discharge serves multiple critical purposes: ensuring continuity of care, meeting regulatory requirements, and providing the receiving caregiver with essential information for supporting the child. Our policy emphasizes that "Documentation and Information Transfer ensures continuity of care" through systematic compilation and transfer of all relevant records.

The importance of thorough discharge documentation cannot be overstated. Children in foster care often experience multiple placements, and each transition risks the loss of critical information about their history, needs, and effective interventions. By maintaining meticulous records and ensuring proper transfer, we help preserve the child's story and support their ongoing journey toward healing and permanency.

These procedures address the CRITICAL REQUIREMENT in TAC §749.1363 mandating specific discharge documentation. The structured approach below ensures all required elements are included while organizing information in a way that is accessible and useful to those who will care for the child going forward.

### 5\. EMERGENCY DISCHARGE PROCEDURES

#### Purpose and Overview

Emergency discharges present unique challenges requiring rapid response while maintaining documentation and support standards. These situations include psychiatric hospitalization, juvenile detention, immediate safety concerns, placement disruption, or court-ordered removals. Despite the urgent nature, we must ensure proper information transfer and support for the child's transition.

Emergency discharge procedures balance the need for immediate action with regulatory requirements and the child's best interests. Staff must be prepared to implement these procedures at any time, maintaining professionalism and trauma-informed approaches even in crisis situations.

## CRITICAL REMINDERS for Enhanced Packages:

⚠️ **15 BUSINESS DAY DEADLINE**: All Enhanced Continued Stay Confirmations MUST be submitted to SSCC/DFPS within 15 business days of the 90-day review. Missing this deadline is a compliance violation.

⚠️ **BOTH SIGNATURES REQUIRED**: The Enhanced Continued Stay Confirmation Form requires BOTH Program Director AND Treatment Director signatures. One signature alone is insufficient.

⚠️ **MANDATORY AFTERCARE**: Mental Health and IDD/Autism packages require 6 months of aftercare services with twice-monthly contact. This is NOT optional.

⚠️ **CLINICAL JUSTIFICATION**: Generic statements are insufficient. Specific, measurable clinical indicators must support continued stay determinations.
