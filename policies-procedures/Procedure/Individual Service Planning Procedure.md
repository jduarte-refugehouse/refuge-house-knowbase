## PROCEDURE:

### 1\. T3C SERVICE PACKAGE VERIFICATION AND COMPLIANCE PLANNING

#### Purpose and Overview

The foundation of effective service planning begins with proper verification that both Refuge House and the foster home are credentialed to provide the assigned T3C Service Package. This verification must occur before service planning begins to ensure appropriate services from qualified providers.

The T3C system requires that providers maintain specific credentials for each Service Package they deliver. Mismatches between child needs and provider credentials can result in service denials, placement disruptions, and compliance violations. This section ensures all placements are properly verified and implementation plans are developed for package-specific requirements.

### 1.7 CANS 3.0 Assessment Implementation

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** All T3C Service Packages (SU p.60, STASS p.71, TFFC p.139 - October 2025)

#### Purpose and Overview

The Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS 3.0) Assessment is a comprehensive tool that informs individualized service planning and measures outcomes across multiple life domains. For children over age 3, CANS 3.0 assessments are required at specified intervals and directly guide service planning decisions.

CANS 3.0 assesses needs and strengths across domains including behavioral/emotional health, life functioning, risk behaviors, caregiver resources, and traumatic experiences. Results provide objective data to support clinical decision-making and track progress over time.

#### Assessment Frequency by Child Age

| Child Age | Initial Assessment | Ongoing Assessments | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|-------|
| 0-3 years | Not required | Not required | May complete if clinically indicated |
| 3-5 years | Within 21 days | Every 90 days | Required for T3C packages |
| 6+ years | Within 30 days | Every 90 days | Required for T3C packages |

**Package-Specific Considerations:**

*Short-Term Assessment:* Initial CANS 3.0 required within timeline; ongoing typically not applicable due to 30-45 day placement duration unless extension granted beyond 90 days.

#### CANS 3.0 Integration with Service Planning

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** All T3C Service Packages require CANS 3.0 results to inform Service Plans including service type, frequency, and duration adjustments (SU p.60, STASS p.71, TFFC p.139 - October 2025)

##### At Initial Service Plan (30 days)

CANS 3.0 results must directly inform all aspects of the initial Service Plan:

| CANS Domain Finding | Service Planning Response | Documentation Required |
|---------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| High-Need Domain (Rating 2-3) | Create specific goal addressing domain | Goal references CANS domain and rating |
| Multiple High-Need Domains | Prioritize goals; determine service intensity | Service Plan notes CANS complexity justifying intensity |
| Behavioral/Emotional Needs | Determine therapy type and frequency | Therapy authorization includes CANS justification |
| Caregiver Resource Depletion | Plan caregiver support and respite | Service Plan includes caregiver strengthening goals |
| Risk Behaviors Present | Develop safety plan and monitoring | Safety plan references specific CANS risk domains |
| Strengths Identified (Rating 0-1 strengths) | Leverage in treatment approach | Goals note how strengths support progress |

**Service Type Determination:**
- Individual therapy: CANS behavioral/emotional domains with actionable needs
- Family therapy: CANS caregiver or family functioning domains showing needs
- Group therapy: CANS peer relations or social functioning domains
- Specialized interventions: Domain-specific needs (e.g., trauma-focused therapy for traumatic stress domains)

**Service Frequency Determination:**
- Weekly therapy: CANS domains at rating 2 (actionable need)
- Multiple weekly sessions: CANS domains at rating 3 (dangerous/disabling) or multiple rating 2 domains
- Monthly or less frequent: CANS domains at rating 0-1 (strengths or watchful waiting)

**Service Duration Planning:**
- Short-term (3-6 months): Limited high-need domains with good prognosis
- Moderate-term (6-12 months): Multiple domains requiring sustained intervention
- Long-term (12+ months): Complex presentations across multiple life domains

##### At Ongoing Service Plan Reviews

| Who | How | When | Where | Regulatory Reference |
|-----|-----|------|-------|---------------------|
| Treatment Director | 1. Compare current CANS to previous assessment(s)<br>2. Identify domains with improvement, decline, or stability<br>3. Analyze whether current services effectively addressing needs<br>4. Recommend service adjustments based on CANS trends | Before each Service Plan review | CANS comparison analysis | T3C Blueprint p.60, 71, 139 (October 2025) |
| Service Planning Team | 1. Review CANS comparison data<br>2. Discuss effectiveness of current service array<br>3. Determine if service type still matches needs<br>4. Adjust service frequency based on progress/regression<br>5. Modify service duration based on trajectory | At Service Plan review meeting | Service Planning meeting | T3C Blueprint p.60, 71, 139 (October 2025) |
| Case Manager | Document in Service Plan:<br>1. Current CANS domain ratings vs. previous<br>2. Service effectiveness analysis per domain<br>3. Service adjustments with CANS-based rationale<br>4. Projected CANS targets for next review period | During/after Service Plan review | Service Plan in Radius | T3C Blueprint p.60, 71, 139 (October 2025) |

**CANS-Driven Service Adjustments:**

*When CANS shows improvement:*
- Decrease therapy frequency if sustained improvement across multiple assessments
- Consider step-down to less intensive service package if appropriate
- Shift focus to relapse prevention and skill consolidation
- Leverage improved domains as strengths to address remaining needs

*When CANS shows regression or lack of progress:*
- Increase therapy frequency
- Add new service modalities (e.g., add family therapy, specialized interventions)
- Intensify existing services
- Consider step-up to more intensive package if appropriate
- Conduct clinical staffing to analyze barriers and develop new approach

*When CANS shows mixed results:*
- Continue effective services for improving domains
- Modify approach for domains showing no progress
- Add targeted interventions for newly emerged needs
- Maintain overall service intensity while adjusting specific components

##### Documentation Standards for CANS Integration

**Initial Service Plan Must Include:**
- Table or narrative summarizing key CANS findings
- Explicit connection between CANS domains and goals
- Service frequency justification referencing CANS severity
- Service type selection rationale based on CANS needs

**Service Plan Reviews Must Include:**
- CANS comparison table (current vs. previous)
- Analysis of progress/regression by domain
- Service effectiveness evaluation linked to CANS changes
- Specific service adjustments with CANS-based rationale
- Updated service frequency with CANS justification

**Example Documentation:**

*Good:* "John's CANS shows improvement in Behavioral/Emotional Needs from 2 to 1, indicating weekly individual therapy has been effective. However, his Caregiver Resources domain declined from 1 to 2, necessitating addition of monthly family therapy to strengthen caregiver support and prevent placement disruption."

*Poor:* "Services adjusted based on progress and continued needs."

##### Purpose and Overview

Service Plan reviews must demonstrate the progress made toward achieving each goal identified in the Service Plan. This goal-by-goal documentation ensures accountability, allows for data-driven adjustments to services, and provides clear evidence of treatment effectiveness or need for modification.

Generic statements like "child is doing well" or "some progress noted" do not meet this requirement. Each goal requires individualized progress analysis with specific examples.
