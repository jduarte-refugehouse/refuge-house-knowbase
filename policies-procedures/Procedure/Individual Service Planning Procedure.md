## PROCEDURE:

### 1\. T3C SERVICE PACKAGE VERIFICATION AND COMPLIANCE PLANNING

#### Purpose and Overview

The foundation of effective service planning begins with proper verification that both Refuge House and the foster home are credentialed to provide the assigned T3C Service Package. This verification must occur before service planning begins to ensure appropriate services from qualified providers.

The T3C system requires that providers maintain specific credentials for each Service Package they deliver. Mismatches between child needs and provider credentials can result in service denials, placement disruptions, and compliance violations. This section ensures all placements are properly verified and implementation plans are developed for package-specific requirements.

### 2\. SERVICE PLAN DEVELOPMENT TIMELINES AND PROCESSES

#### Purpose and Overview

Service planning timelines are among the most critical regulatory requirements, with the 30-day timeline carrying high weight in compliance monitoring. This section ensures all team members understand their roles in meeting these mandatory timelines while developing quality, individualized plans.

The service planning process must balance regulatory compliance with meaningful, trauma-informed planning that truly addresses each child's unique needs. By following these structured processes, teams can achieve both compliance and quality outcomes.
