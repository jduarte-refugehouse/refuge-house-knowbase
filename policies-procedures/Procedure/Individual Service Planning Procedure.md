## PROCEDURE:

### 1\. T3C SERVICE PACKAGE VERIFICATION AND COMPLIANCE PLANNING

#### Purpose and Overview

The foundation of effective service planning begins with proper verification that both Refuge House and the foster home are credentialed to provide the assigned T3C Service Package. This verification must occur before service planning begins to ensure appropriate services from qualified providers.

The T3C system requires that providers maintain specific credentials for each Service Package they deliver. Mismatches between child needs and provider credentials can result in service denials, placement disruptions, and compliance violations. This section ensures all placements are properly verified and implementation plans are developed for package-specific requirements.

| Who | How | When | Where | Regulatory Reference |

### 2\. SERVICE PLAN DEVELOPMENT TIMELINES AND PROCESSES

#### Purpose and Overview

Service planning timelines are among the most critical regulatory requirements, with the 30-day timeline carrying high weight in compliance monitoring. This section ensures all team members understand their roles in meeting these mandatory timelines while developing quality, individualized plans.

The service planning process must balance regulatory compliance with meaningful, trauma-informed planning that truly addresses each child's unique needs. By following these structured processes, teams can achieve both compliance and quality outcomes.

#### 2.4 Youth Participation in Service Planning

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** All T3C Service Packages require youth-informed service planning (SU p.59, STASS p.70, TFFC p.138)

##### Purpose and Overview

Service Plans must be informed by the child, youth, or young adult (when age-appropriate) and include customized goals developed through meaningful youth participation. This requirement ensures youth voice drives service planning rather than being an afterthought.

| Who | How | When | Where | Regulatory Reference |
|-----|-----|------|-------|---------------------|

Use age-appropriate methods to gather input:<br>   - Verbal discussion for older youth<br>   - Visual aids and simplified language for younger children<br>   - Written surveys or preference assessments<br>   - Drawing/creative expression for younger children<br>3. Document youth's goals, preferences, and priorities in their own words<br>4. Prepare youth for participation in planning meeting<br>5.

Ensure cultural considerations reflected in goals and services | At Service Planning meeting | Service Planning meeting | T3C Blueprint p.59, 70, 138 |
| Case Manager | Document in Service Plan:<br>1. Youth's stated goals (in their words when possible)<br>2. Level of youth participation<br>3. How services align with youth-identified needs<br>4. Cultural considerations incorporated<br>5. Any concerns youth expressed<br>6. Youth's understanding of the plan | During/after Service Planning meeting | Service Plan in Radius | T3C Blueprint p.59, 70, 138 |

**Package-Specific Considerations:**

*Short-Term Assessment:* Youth goals focus on supporting assessment process and preparing for transition to receiving Service Package.

*Substance Use:* Youth goals include recovery objectives and relapse prevention strategies developed with youth input.

*TFFC:* Youth goals address intensive mental health needs while honoring youth's perspective on their challenges and desired outcomes.

#### 2.5 Enhanced Continued Stay Requirements for Specialized Packages

The Mental & Behavioral Health and IDD/Autism packages require enhanced documentation and review processes to ensure children receive appropriate intensive services while progressing toward less restrictive placements.

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** All T3C Service Packages require goal-specific progress documentation in Service Plan reviews (SU p.59, STASS p.70, TFFC p.138)

##### Purpose and Overview

Service Plan reviews must demonstrate the progress made toward achieving each goal identified in the Service Plan. This goal-by-goal documentation ensures accountability, allows for data-driven adjustments to services, and provides clear evidence of treatment effectiveness or need for modification.

Generic statements like "child is doing well" or "some progress noted" do not meet this requirement. Each goal requires individualized progress analysis with specific examples.

| Service Planning Team | 1. Review progress for each goal collaboratively<br>2. Discuss what's working and what's not<br>3. Determine if goals need modification<br>4. Identify service adjustments needed<br>5. Document team consensus on progress | At Service Plan review meeting | Service Plan review meeting | T3C Blueprint p.59, 70, 138 |
| Case Manager | Document for each goal:<br>1. **Current Status:** Level of progress (no/minimal/moderate/significant/achieved)<br>2. **Specific Examples:** Observable behaviors or achievements demonstrating current functioning<br>3. **Effective Supports:** What services/interventions are helping<br>4. **Barriers:** What's hindering progress<br>5. **Adjustments:** Changes needed to services, supports, or goal itself<br>6. **Next Steps:** Action plan for continued progress | During/after Service Plan review | Service Plan in Radius | T3C Blueprint p.59, 70, 138 |

**Documentation Template for Each Goal:**
