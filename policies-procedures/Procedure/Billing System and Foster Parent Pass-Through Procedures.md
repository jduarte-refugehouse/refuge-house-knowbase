### 1\. INITIAL PLACEMENT BILLING SETUP

#### Purpose and Overview

Accurate billing begins at the moment of placement.

Radius automates much of this process, but human verification remains essential to catch any discrepancies before they impact payments to our foster families.

### 2\. SEMI-MONTHLY BILLING PROCESSES

#### Purpose and Overview

Since our founding, Refuge House has maintained a consistent semi-monthly billing cycle that demonstrates our commitment to foster families by paying them promptly, often before we receive our own reimbursement. This established practice shows fiscal responsibility and builds trust with our caregivers by providing predictable compensation on a reliable schedule.

**CRITICAL PRACTICE:** We pay foster families on the **15th and last day of each month** regardless of when we receive state reimbursement, demonstrating our financial stability and commitment to our caregivers.

**Payment Schedule:**

- **Period A (1st-15th):** Paid on the 15th of the following month  
- **Period B (16th-last day):** Paid on the last day of the following month

### 6\. FOSTER PARENT PAYMENT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCESS
