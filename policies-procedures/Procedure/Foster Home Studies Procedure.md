### 7\. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

**Purpose and Overview**

Systematic quality review ensures home studies meet standards while continuously improving processes. Digital analytics enable data-driven improvements.

| Who | How | When | Where | Regulatory Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Quality Assurance Manager | Review study quality via dashboards: 1\. Sample review for completeness 2\. Assess credentialing consistency 3\. Identify training needs 4\. Track timeline compliance5. Report findings | Quarterly | QA review dashboard | TAC §749.43 |
| Home Development Team | Team improvement meetings: 1\. Review difficult cases 2\. Share best practices 3\. Discuss credentialing challenges 4\. Update procedures5. Plan enhancements | Monthly | Team meeting platform | Continuous improvement |

### 8\. HOME STUDY ADDENDUM PROCEDURES

**Purpose and Overview**

A home study addendum is a formal supplement to an existing foster family home study that documents changes, updates, or additional assessments without requiring a complete rewrite of the original study. Per TAC §749.2803(a)(5), changes in the types of services the foster home will provide trigger an addendum requirement. The addendum must stand on its own as a credentialing document while referencing the original home study as the foundational assessment.
