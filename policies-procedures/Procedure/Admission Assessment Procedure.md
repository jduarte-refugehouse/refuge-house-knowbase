## PROCEDURE:

### 1\. ADMISSION ASSESSMENT TIMELINES

**Purpose and Overview**

The admission assessment serves as both a regulatory requirement and the first opportunity to build trust with children entering care. Through TBRI®-informed practices, we transform the assessment from a clinical evaluation into a relational experience that communicates safety, respect, and hope. As stated in our policy, "the assessment process itself is an intervention" that begins the healing journey.

The specific timelines for completing assessments vary based on placement type, with **CRITICAL TIMEFRAMES** established by TAC §749.1301 and §749.1305. However, our approach prioritizes the child's emotional safety and readiness throughout the process.

### 2\. INFORMATION GATHERING

**Purpose and Overview**

Comprehensive information gathering is the foundation for understanding each child's unique needs, strengths, and experiences. Our policy emphasizes "taking into consideration valuable resources of information from CPS, previous foster agencies, and any other invested entities." This collaborative approach ensures we have the most complete picture possible while recognizing that some information may only be revealed as trust develops over time.

The TBRI® lens reminds us that all behavior has meaning. During information gathering, we seek to understand not just what behaviors occur, but what needs they communicate and what past experiences may drive them.
