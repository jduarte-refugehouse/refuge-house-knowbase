## PURPOSE:

To establish a comprehensive approach to identifying, engaging, and maintaining meaningful connections between children in care and their families, siblings, relatives, kinship caregivers, and other supportive persons to promote permanency, emotional well-being, and positive outcomes for children in foster care.

## POLICY:

Refuge House recognizes that family connections are essential to a child's sense of identity, cultural continuity, and overall well-being. In alignment with our Evidence-informed Treatment Model (TBRI), we acknowledge that healthy relationships are fundamental to a child's development, healing from trauma, and overall well-being.

Refuge House is committed to implementing a family engagement approach that proactively identifies, outreaches to, and collaborates with the child's biological parents, siblings, relatives, potential kinship caregivers, and other supportive persons throughout the child's placement. We believe these connections support permanency planning, improve placement stability, and contribute to positive outcomes for children and youth in care.

While Refuge House recognizes that DFPS/SSCC maintains primary responsibility for visitation planning and supervision, we are committed to supporting these plans, documenting family engagement efforts, and providing trauma-informed guidance to foster families in facilitating positive connections in accordance with regulatory requirements and the child's best interests.

As required by §749.1301-1335 and the T3C Blueprint, family engagement efforts will be thoroughly documented in each child's Service Plan, reviewed at least every six months, and incorporated into the child's permanency goals. In accordance with RCC Contract Term 7, Refuge House will regularly communicate with DFPS/SSCC regarding family engagement efforts and their impact on the child's well-being and progress toward permanency.
