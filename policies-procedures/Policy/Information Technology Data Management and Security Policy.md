## PURPOSE

This policy establishes Refuge House's commitment to maintaining secure, accurate, and comprehensive information technology systems that support quality service delivery while ensuring compliance with T3C System Blueprint requirements, HIPAA regulations, and Texas child welfare standards. Our IT infrastructure serves as the backbone for implementing our TBRI®-informed approach to care, enabling real-time monitoring of child safety and well-being while supporting our foster families with accessible, secure tools.

## POLICY

Refuge House maintains enterprise-grade information technology systems that exceed industry standards for child welfare agencies. We recognize that effective IT systems are essential for tracking outcomes, ensuring child safety, supporting caregivers, and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements. Our technology infrastructure directly supports our mission by enabling data-driven decision-making and facilitating communication among all members of the care team.

Our IT systems will:

- Protect the confidentiality and integrity of all protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII)  
- Support comprehensive case management documentation aligned with T3C requirements  
- Enable accurate billing and foster parent payment processes  
- Facilitate quality assurance and continuous quality improvement initiatives  
- Provide secure access to authorized users while preventing unauthorized access  
- Maintain complete audit trails for all system activities  
- Support outcome tracking at both child and foster home levels

*This policy document establishes the governing principles for Information Technology Data Management and Security. The corresponding procedure documents operationalize these principles by providing specific implementation details (who, when, where, and how). While policies require Board approval and remain relatively stable, procedures may be updated by the Executive Director to adapt to regulatory changes, technological advancements, or operational improvements without requiring Board approval, provided such changes maintain alignment with the policy's intent.*
