## PURPOSE

This policy establishes Refuge House's commitment to developing and implementing comprehensive, individualized service plans for all children in foster care placement. Service planning at Refuge House integrates T3C System requirements, trauma-informed approaches through Trust-Based Relational Intervention® (TBRI®), and regulatory compliance to ensure each child receives services tailored to their unique needs, strengths, and permanency goals.

## POLICY STATEMENT

Refuge House recognizes that effective service planning is the cornerstone of quality foster care. Every child deserves a thoughtful, comprehensive plan that addresses their physical, emotional, educational, developmental, and permanency needs while incorporating the voice of the child and their family. Service plans will be developed collaboratively, implemented consistently, and reviewed regularly to ensure progress toward positive outcomes.
