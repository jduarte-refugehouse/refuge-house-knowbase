## PURPOSE:

To establish Refuge House's comprehensive home study process that serves as both a collaborative, culturally responsive, in-depth assessment of families and homes to ensure safety and stability for those placed, and as the foundation for T3C Foster Family Home credentialing assessment. The process ensures that families are evaluated for both standard DFPS licensing requirements and specialized T3C service delivery capabilities while maintaining a trauma-informed, strength-based approach.

## POLICY:

The Refuge House home study process is a collaborative, culturally responsive, in-depth assessment of a family and home to ensure safety and stability for those placed. The process of assessment begins at the moment of recruitment and is not completed until a family or individual is either verified or denied through our organization. This comprehensive assessment simultaneously evaluates families for DFPS licensing requirements and T3C Foster Family Home credentialing capabilities, ensuring seamless integration between standard licensing and specialized service delivery requirements.

In considering both new and prospective transfer caregivers, Refuge House does so without discrimination due to race, age, sex, national origin, or handicap(s). Refuge House is a Christian Agency that believes in traditional family values. Therefore, at this time, Refuge House does not verify same-sex couples.

## INTEGRATED T3C CREDENTIALING:

### Dual Purpose Assessment:

The home study process incorporates the Foster Family Home Credentialing Assessment required by T3C Blueprint page 33, which states that Child Placing Agencies must have "a process in place to assess individual foster homes and Foster Family Home Caregivers to provide the Child Placing Agency's Credentialed services." This integrated approach:

- Evaluates families for both DFPS licensing and T3C credentialing simultaneously  
- Reduces duplication of assessments and streamlines the verification process  
- Ensures all verified families are assessed for T3C Basic Foster Family Home capabilities  
- Identifies potential for specialized service packages (Mental & Behavioral Health, IDD/Autism)

### Credentialing Components Assessed During Home Study:

1. **TBRI® Competency**: Understanding and commitment to Trust-Based Relational Intervention®
2. **Trauma-Informed Care Readiness**: Ability to provide therapeutic parenting
3. **Service Delivery Capacity**: Resources, time, and commitment for T3C requirements
4. **Package-Specific Capabilities**: Assessment for specialized service packages as appropriate
5. **Training Completion**: Verification of all required pre-service training
6. **Environmental Therapeutic Appropriateness**: Home environment supports healing
7. **Substance Use Support Readiness**: For families seeking SU credential, assessment of understanding of addiction as disease, recovery-supportive approach, and ability to maintain substance-free home environment
8. **Short-Term Assessment Capacity**: For families seeking STASS credential, assessment of observation/documentation skills, ability to manage short-term placements and transitions, and capacity compliance (maximum 4 children)
9. **Treatment Foster Care Intensive Capacity**: For families seeking TFFC credential, assessment of availability for intensive services (multiple meetings per week, 24/7 crisis response), ability to implement intensive behavior support plans, and capacity compliance (maximum 2 children)

*This policy document establishes the governing principles for Home Studies integrated with T3C Credentialing. The corresponding procedure document (FC-17.1) operationalizes these principles by providing specific implementation details (who, when, where, and how). While policies require Board approval and remain relatively stable, procedures may be updated by the Executive Director to adapt to regulatory changes, technological advancements, or operational improvements without requiring Board approval, provided such changes maintain alignment with the policy's intent.*
