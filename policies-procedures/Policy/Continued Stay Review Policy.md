## 1. PURPOSE

This policy establishes Refuge House's framework for conducting continued stay reviews to ensure children receive appropriate levels of care without unnecessary restriction in intensive placements. Continued stay reviews balance each child's need for specialized services with the principle of least restrictive environment, ensuring children do not remain in intensive placements longer than clinically necessary while verifying that ongoing service needs are met.

---

## 2. GOVERNING PRINCIPLES

### 2.1 Least Restrictive Environment

Refuge House is committed to placing children in the least restrictive setting appropriate to meet their individualized needs. Continued stay reviews systematically evaluate whether children can safely transition to less intensive service packages or permanency placements.

### 2.2 Child-Centered Decision Making

All continued stay determinations are based on the child's current functioning, treatment progress, and ongoing service needs as documented through CANS 3.0 assessments and Service Plan reviews. Decisions prioritize child safety, well-being, and permanency.

### 2.3 Clinical Integrity

For specialized service packages, continued stay determinations require clinical justification supported by specific, measurable indicators. Generic statements are insufficient; documentation must demonstrate ongoing need for the current level of care.

### 2.4 Regulatory Compliance

Continued stay reviews comply with TAC Chapter 749 Minimum Standards, T3C Blueprint requirements, RCC Contract obligations, and applicable state law including Texas Family Code §264.1073 for Treatment Foster Family Care.

## 3. REVIEW FREQUENCY BY SERVICE PACKAGE

### 3.1 Standard Review Cycles

| Service Package | Review Frequency | Signature Requirements | SSCC/DFPS Submission |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **T3C Basic Foster Family Home** | Every 6 months | Program Director | N/A |
| **Mental & Behavioral Health** | Every 90 days | Program Director AND Treatment Director | Within 15 business days |
| **IDD/Autism Spectrum Disorder** | Every 90 days | Program Director AND Treatment Director | Within 15 business days |
| **Substance Use Support Services** | Every 90 days | Program Director AND Treatment Director | Within 15 business days |
| **T3C Treatment Foster Family Care** | Every 60 days | Program Director AND Treatment Director | Within 15 business days |

### 3.2 Treatment Foster Family Care - Enhanced Requirements

Per Texas Family Code §264.1073 and TAC §700.1335, Treatment Foster Family Care requires more frequent review (60 days) due to the intensive, time-limited nature of services (maximum 365-day length of stay). Both Program Director and Treatment Director must provide written confirmation at each review.

### 3.3 Short-Term Assessment Support Services - Not Applicable

Short-Term Assessment Support Services does NOT require continued stay reviews. This package is time-limited by design (30-45 days with possible 15-day extension) with the primary purpose of completing comprehensive assessments to determine appropriate ongoing Service Package placement. Children transition to receiving Service Packages upon assessment completion rather than remaining in continued stay.

- Initiate transition planning per FC14-01 Discharge and Permanency Planning Policy
