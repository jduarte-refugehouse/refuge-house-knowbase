## PURPOSE

This policy establishes Refuge House's commitment to comprehensive permanency planning, continued stay evaluations, and trauma-informed discharge processes for all children in foster care placement. We recognize that transitions represent critical moments in children's lives requiring careful planning, coordination, and support to ensure successful outcomes.

## POLICY STATEMENT

Every child deserves a permanent, safe, and nurturing home. Refuge House is committed to pursuing permanency from the moment of admission through successful discharge. Our approach integrates T3C System requirements, Trust-Based Relational Intervention® (TBRI®) principles, and regulatory standards to ensure transitions support each child's well-being and long-term success.

## PROVISIONS

### 1\. PERMANENCY PLANNING

Permanency planning begins at admission and is incorporated into every service plan, with specific goals and action steps designed to support the child's permanency outcome. Refuge House actively works toward:

- Reunification with biological family when safe and appropriate  
- Adoption when reunification is not possible  
- Permanent placement with relatives or kinship caregivers  
- Another planned permanent living arrangement for older youth

Planning activities include:

- Regular assessment of permanency progress  
- Active family engagement and support  
- Collaboration with DFPS/SSCC on permanency goals  
- Documentation of all permanency efforts  
- Removal of barriers to permanency achievement

### 2\. CONTINUED STAY EVALUATIONS

Regular evaluation of continued placement need ensures children receive appropriate levels of care without unnecessary restriction. Reviews occur:

- At minimum every 6 months for all placements  
- Every 90 days for specialized Service Packages  
- When significant changes occur in the child's needs or circumstances  
- Prior to extending placement beyond expected Service Package duration

Continued stay determinations are based on:

- Current CANS 3.0 Assessment results  
- Progress toward service plan goals  
- Availability of less restrictive alternatives  
- Child and family preferences  
- Clinical recommendations from the treatment team

### 3\. DISCHARGE CATEGORIES AND PROCESSES

Refuge House recognizes two primary categories of discharge:

- Planned Discharge: Includes achievement of permanency goals through reunification, adoption, permanent placement with relatives, or another planned permanent living arrangement  
- Emergency Discharge: Includes hospitalization, detention, court-ordered removal, immediate safety concerns, disruption due to placement breakdown, or DFPS-initiated discharge without advance notice

Discharge planning is conducted in accordance with TBRI principles to support felt safety during transitions, incorporating:

- Age-appropriate preparation for the child  
- Trauma-informed transition rituals  
- Communication that supports the child's emotional regulation  
- Appropriate transfer of attachment relationships  
- Maintenance of important connections

Documentation and Information Transfer ensures continuity of care through:

- Comprehensive discharge summaries  
- Complete medical, dental, and mental health records  
- Educational records and portfolios  
- Medication information with clear instructions  
- Contact information for all providers  
- Recommendations for ongoing services and supports

All discharge actions fully comply with:

- T3C Blueprint requirements  
- TAC §749 Minimum Standards  
- RCC Contract requirements  
- SSCC Contract requirements (where applicable)  
- TBRI® principles and practices

## PACKAGE-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:

- Medication storage protocols (if medication-assisted treatment applies)
- Recovery meeting/support group connections in new location

### ☒ SHORT-TERM ASSESSMENT SUPPORT SERVICES

For children receiving Short-Term Assessment Support Services, recognizing the unique assessment-focused, time-limited nature of this package:

**Assessment-to-Service-Package Transition Focus:** This package does NOT involve traditional discharge to permanency. Instead, children transition to an appropriate ongoing Service Package based on assessment findings. Planning addresses:

- Service Package determination based on comprehensive assessment results
- CANS 3.0 interpretation and Service Package recommendation
- Coordination with receiving CPA or foster home for appropriate Service Package
- Transfer of all assessment documentation to receiving Case Manager
- Warm handoff procedures to ensure continuity

**Time-Limited Parameters:**

| Child Age | Maximum Stay | Extension Available |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Age 5 and under | 30 days | One 15-day extension |
| Over age 5 | 45 days | One 15-day extension |

Extensions require Program Director written approval with documented justification.

**Service Package Determination Process:**

1. Treatment Director reviews all assessment findings and CANS 3.0 results
2. Treatment Director recommends appropriate ongoing Service Package with clinical justification
3. Service Planning Team confirms recommendation within 5 days
4. Case Manager coordinates transition to receiving placement
5. Comprehensive Transition Summary prepared before discharge

**Transition Summary Components:**

- All assessment results and findings with interpretation
- CANS 3.0 assessment results
- Behavioral observations and effective strategies identified during assessment
- Medical/dental/vision records obtained during assessment period
- Educational records and recommendations
- Service Package recommendation with detailed clinical justification
- Foster family observations and insights

**NO AFTERCARE REQUIRED:** Aftercare services per **FC-AF-01 Aftercare Services Policy** are NOT required for Short-Term Assessment Support Services. This package serves an assessment function, with the child transitioning to a receiving Service Package that will provide ongoing services and any applicable aftercare. Case Manager ensures complete documentation handoff to receiving Case Manager.

**NO CONTINUED STAY REVIEWS:** Due to the time-limited nature (30-45 days + 15-day extension maximum), Continued Stay Reviews per **FC-CSR-01 Continued Stay Review Policy** do NOT apply to this package.

### ☒ T3C TREATMENT FOSTER FAMILY CARE (Enhanced)

For children in Treatment Foster Family Care, recognizing the intensive, time-limited nature of this highest-level family-based intervention:

**Time-Limited Service with Mandatory Step-Down Focus:**

| Parameter | Duration |
|-----------|----------|
| Standard Treatment Period | Up to 274 days |
| Extension (if clinically necessary) | Up to 91 additional days |
| **Maximum Total** | **365 days** |

**CRITICAL:** An individual child cannot be served under this package for more than 365 days per T3C Blueprint p.142 and Texas Family Code Section 264.1073.

**Step-Down Planning from Day 1:** Due to the time-limited nature of this package, step-down planning begins at admission and is integrated into every 60-day Service Plan Review. Initial Service Plan must include preliminary step-down goals.

**Dual Credentialing Requirement:** Both the Child Placing Agency AND the Foster Family Home must maintain credentials for BOTH Treatment Foster Family Care AND T3C Basic Foster Family Home packages. This enables same-home step-down when clinically appropriate.

**60-Day Continued Stay Reviews:** Per **FC-CSR-01 Continued Stay Review Policy**, at each 60-day review:

- Treatment Director and Program Director must provide written confirmation
- Documentation submitted to SSCC/DFPS within 15 business days
- Step-down readiness assessed at each review
- Clinical justification required for continued intensive services

**Step-Down Options:**

| Option | Requirements |
|--------|--------------|
| Same home - Basic Package | Home dually credentialed; child stable; foster family willing to continue |
| Different home - Basic Package | Appropriate home identified; transition planning completed |
| Different home - Other Package | Alternative Service Package appropriate; transition coordinated |
| Permanency placement | Permanency resource identified; preparation completed |

**Step-Down Readiness Indicators:**

- Behavioral stability with reduced crisis frequency
- Treatment progress on identified goals
- Decreased need for intensive clinical intervention
- Foster family capacity to maintain gains with less support
- Absence of criteria that required intensive services

**Intensive Discharge Planning:** Given the expected 4-6 month length of service, discharge planning includes:

- Clear step-down criteria and timeline established at admission
- Identification of less-restrictive placement options early in treatment
- Assessment of step-down readiness at each 60-day review
- Detailed documentation of all effective behavioral interventions
- Comprehensive behavior management guide for receiving placement
- Transfer of crisis prevention and de-escalation strategies

**Mandatory Aftercare Services:** Treatment Foster Family Care requires 6 months of intensive aftercare services per **FC-AF-01 Aftercare Services Policy** including:

- **Weekly contacts during first month** post-discharge
- **Twice-monthly contacts for months 2-6**
- 24/7 crisis consultation availability
