## PURPOSE

This policy establishes Refuge House's commitment to comprehensive permanency planning, continued stay evaluations, and trauma-informed discharge processes for all children in foster care placement. We recognize that transitions represent critical moments in children's lives requiring careful planning, coordination, and support to ensure successful outcomes.

## POLICY STATEMENT

Every child deserves a permanent, safe, and nurturing home. Refuge House is committed to pursuing permanency from the moment of admission through successful discharge. Our approach integrates T3C System requirements, Trust-Based Relational Intervention® (TBRI®) principles, and regulatory standards to ensure transitions support each child's well-being and long-term success.

## PROVISIONS

### 1\. PERMANENCY PLANNING

Permanency planning begins at admission and is incorporated into every service plan, with specific goals and action steps designed to support the child's permanency outcome. Refuge House actively works toward:

- Reunification with biological family when safe and appropriate  
- Adoption when reunification is not possible  
- Permanent placement with relatives or kinship caregivers  
- Another planned permanent living arrangement for older youth

Planning activities include:

- Regular assessment of permanency progress  
- Active family engagement and support  
- Collaboration with DFPS/SSCC on permanency goals  
- Documentation of all permanency efforts  
- Removal of barriers to permanency achievement

### 2\. CONTINUED STAY EVALUATIONS

Regular evaluation of continued placement need ensures children receive appropriate levels of care without unnecessary restriction. Reviews occur:

- At minimum every 6 months for all placements  
- Every 90 days for specialized Service Packages  
- When significant changes occur in the child's needs or circumstances  
- Prior to extending placement beyond expected Service Package duration

Continued stay determinations are based on:

- Current CANS 3.0 Assessment results  
- Progress toward service plan goals  
- Availability of less restrictive alternatives  
- Child and family preferences  
- Clinical recommendations from the treatment team

### 3\. DISCHARGE CATEGORIES AND PROCESSES

Refuge House recognizes two primary categories of discharge:

- Planned Discharge: Includes achievement of permanency goals through reunification, adoption, permanent placement with relatives, or another planned permanent living arrangement  
- Emergency Discharge: Includes hospitalization, detention, court-ordered removal, immediate safety concerns, disruption due to placement breakdown, or DFPS-initiated discharge without advance notice

Discharge planning is conducted in accordance with TBRI principles to support felt safety during transitions, incorporating:

- Age-appropriate preparation for the child  
- Trauma-informed transition rituals  
- Communication that supports the child's emotional regulation  
- Appropriate transfer of attachment relationships  
- Maintenance of important connections

Documentation and Information Transfer ensures continuity of care through:

- Comprehensive discharge summaries  
- Complete medical, dental, and mental health records  
- Educational records and portfolios  
- Medication information with clear instructions  
- Contact information for all providers  
- Recommendations for ongoing services and supports

All discharge actions fully comply with:

- T3C Blueprint requirements  
- TAC §749 Minimum Standards  
- RCC Contract requirements  
- SSCC Contract requirements (where applicable)  
- TBRI® principles and practices
