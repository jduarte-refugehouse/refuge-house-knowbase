## PURPOSE:

To establish Refuge House's commitment to recruiting, developing, and retaining a diverse group of trauma-informed foster families capable of providing quality care for children awaiting placement, with specialized focus on T3C Basic Foster Family Home Support Services and applicable Add-On Services through comprehensive credentialing, ongoing support, and evidence-based retention strategies.

## POLICY:

Believing a home is in the heart of every child, Refuge House strives to recruit, support, and retain a diverse group of foster parents to provide quality care for the vast needs of children awaiting placement. Our approach integrates recruitment with T3C credentialing requirements, ensuring that families we recruit can be successfully credentialed for T3C Basic Foster Family Home Support Services and applicable Add-On Services.

Refuge House does not work with biological parents; therefore, the Agency does not assist in identifying kin that can be a resource. Refuge House does not work with kinship unless they are licensed caregivers through our Agency. Refuge House does not offer aftercare services due to contract limitations, except as required for T3C Service Packages.

## CORE REQUIREMENTS:

### 1\. Recruitment Philosophy and Approach

Refuge House utilizes multiple recruitment strategies to identify and engage prospective foster families from diverse socioeconomic, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds. Our recruitment efforts focus on families who can provide trauma-informed care using TBRI® principles and who have the capacity to be credentialed for T3C service delivery.

**Recruitment Methods:**

1. **Collaborative Regional Recruitment Meetings** – consortium of agencies within a region working together with the State to recruit foster families  
     
2. **Church Recruitment Efforts** – through engaging our faith-based community, Refuge House works at developing partnerships through speaking to congregations, small groups, and Sunday school classes  
     
3. **Community Engagement Efforts** – through educating our community on the vast needs of foster children, Refuge House works at making presentations to Home Owner Associations, Fitness Associations, and engaging community leaders and other local groups while using compelling and engaging presentations that give a true call to action  
     
4. **Relationship Based Recruitment** – through word of mouth of our existing foster families, personnel, foster care workers, alumni, donors, along with friends and families  
     
5. **Target Specific Recruitment** – through understanding the needs of the children, Refuge House works to recruit for children who are difficult children to place such as teenagers, infants, and those with challenging behaviors and medical needs. Refuge House accomplishes this by speaking to Nursing Organizations, Police and Detention Center Staff and Stay at Home Mom groups. Target specific recruitment also attempts to recruit families associated with tribes in case an Indian child is placed within our Agency. Refuge House wants every child to feel comfortable and free to be themselves while in care  
     
6. **Inbound Marketing** – through strategic Internet placement, Refuge House draws its virtual community to our website

**T3C Integration:** Whatever method of recruitment used, Refuge House incorporates information about T3C service requirements, TBRI® training expectations, and the enhanced support available to families providing T3C services. Recruitment materials and presentations include clear information about T3C credentialing requirements and the specialized nature of trauma-informed care.

### 2\. Initial Contact and Engagement Process

Upon initial contact from prospective foster families, Refuge House provides comprehensive information about foster care requirements, T3C service expectations, and begins the assessment process that will ultimately lead to both DFPS licensing and T3C credentialing.

**Information Sharing:** Refuge House calls upon current families, emancipated youth, personnel, stakeholders, and partners to speak, answer questions, and train those we are attempting to recruit, providing them with a physical connection to our Agency. This personal approach helps prospective families understand both the challenges and rewards of providing T3C-level care.

### 4\. Support and Retention Services

Refuge House was founded on the idea that the Agency works to be family advocates and in turn our families serve as child advocates. To maintain an adequate number of families to meet the needs of children placed within Refuge House, special attention is made to support our families through multiple retention strategies.

**Support Strategies:**

1. **How a placement starts is how a placement will end** \- Refuge House believes that the more time our case managers spend placing a child and reviewing all the documentation with the family results in stability throughout the span of the placement  
     
2. **Availability** \- Refuge House ensures that four levels of personnel including Case Manager, Treatment Manager, Treatment Director, and CEO are available 24/7 to all caregivers for emergencies and non-emergency calls. Multiple contact methods are provided including office & cell phone, text messaging, e-mail, instant messenger, community page, and Face Time or Skype  
     
3. **On-going training** \- Required by the state and key to long-term success of caregivers. Knowledge is power, and understanding this, Refuge House created the RHU training model to streamline training and create something the families would consider important and feel a part of  
     
4. **Events and socials** \- One or two events per year for all caregivers, personnel, and children to get together. Examples include Blueberry and Blackberry picking, roller-skating, minor league baseball games, etc. A family who plays together stays together  
     
5. **Holiday support** \- Christmas support through gift provision ($150 to $500 spent per child), allowing families to give these gifts to children as if they are from them or from "Santa"  
     
6. **Community room on website** \- Secure space for caregivers to create profiles, share information, read blogs from the Agency, support each other through chat room discussions, and share photos  
     
7. **Resource links on Website** \- Additional support beyond traditional case management  
     
8. **Regular and Frequent visitation** \- Case managers provide twice monthly home visits, assistance with transportation to and from visits, court and other appointments, and attend all psychiatric appointments  
     
9. **Radius** \- Secure access to child's record through remote desktop services, providing security and accessibility  
     
10. **Teamwork** \- Foster parent involvement in treatment and service planning, empowering them and encouraging focus on child's goals and permanency plan  
      
11. **Staff Training** \- Retention of caregivers comes through staff development, ensuring knowledge and up-to-date information on trends and interventions  
      
12. **Peer mentoring** \- New foster parents are matched with tenured foster parents for support during the initial process, typically spending 40 hours with a tenured family before verification  
      
13. **Regular and routine breaks** \- Mini-Break reimbursement and Intermittent Alternative Care, providing paid breaks, weekenders, in-home substitute care, and babysitting for toddlers and infants  
      
14. **Caregiver detox sessions** \- Time for foster parents to vent and receive support without fear of judgment and retaliation  
      
15. **Community and Extended Family Support** \- Reaching out to support systems including family, church, and other organizations they may be involved in, including tribal representatives when applicable  
      
16. **Recreation** \- Family activities that require time together such as walks, biking, hiking, camping, etc.  
      
17. **Responsiveness** \- All missed phone calls returned within 24 hours to all caregivers if not an emergency, with same standards for e-mails  
      
18. **Emergency Responsiveness** \- 24/7 availability during emergencies, with protocols for runaways, sexually acting out behavior, physical altercations, theft, property damage, communicable disease, serious illness, death, divorce, etc.

*This policy document establishes the governing principles for Recruitment and Retention of Foster Families. The corresponding procedure document (FC-16.1) operationalizes these principles by providing specific implementation details (who, when, where, and how). While policies require Board approval and remain relatively stable, procedures may be updated by the Executive Director to adapt to regulatory changes, technological advancements, or operational improvements without requiring Board approval, provided such changes maintain alignment with the policy's intent.*
