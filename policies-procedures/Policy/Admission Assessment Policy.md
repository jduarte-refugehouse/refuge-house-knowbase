## PURPOSE:

To establish a comprehensive, trauma-informed approach to initial assessments of children and youth admitted to Refuge House foster homes, ensuring all regulatory requirements are met while integrating Trust-Based Relational Intervention (TBRI®) principles throughout the assessment process. The assessment serves as the foundation for understanding each child's unique strengths, needs, and experiences of trauma, enabling the development of individualized, healing-centered service plans.

## BACKGROUND:

Refuge House recognizes that every child entering care has experienced relational trauma through separation from their family of origin and potentially other traumatic experiences. Our admission assessment process is designed to gather essential information while building trust and establishing the foundation for healing relationships. By integrating TBRI® principles from the moment of admission, we create an environment of felt safety that supports accurate assessment and effective service planning.

## POLICY:

Refuge House utilizes a cooperative, trauma-informed approach to the development of the Admission Assessment, taking into consideration valuable resources of information from CPS, previous foster agencies, and any other invested entities. The assessment process incorporates the three core TBRI® principles \- Connecting, Empowering, and Correcting \- to ensure that children feel safe, valued, and understood throughout the evaluation process.

Refuge House utilizes a strengths-based approach to the development of the Admission Assessment while ensuring that characteristics unique to each child are emphasized to focus on integrating the child into the family in a way that guides the development of the child's service/permanency plan, goals, engagement in services, and overall care. Through the lens of TBRI®, we recognize that all behavior has meaning and seek to understand the needs being communicated through both adaptive and maladaptive behaviors.

## TBRI® INTEGRATION IN ASSESSMENT:

### Connecting Principles in Assessment

The admission assessment process prioritizes building trust and connection by:

- Conducting assessments in environments where children feel safe and comfortable
- Using warm, accepting tone and body language during all interactions
- Allowing children to have a trusted person present during assessment activities
- Beginning with strengths and interests before exploring challenging topics
- Respecting the child's pace and readiness to share information
- Recognizing that trust must be earned before children will share their full story

### Empowering Principles in Assessment

The assessment addresses physiological and environmental needs by evaluating:

- Current and historical patterns of eating, sleeping, and hydration
- Sensory processing preferences and sensitivities
- Physical activity needs and preferences
- Environmental factors that promote or hinder felt safety
- Medical conditions that may impact behavior or emotional regulation
- Need for predictable routines and transitions

### Correcting Principles in Assessment

The assessment identifies opportunities for growth and skill-building by:

- Viewing challenging behaviors as survival skills that can be redirected
- Identifying proactive strategies that have been successful in the past
- Assessing the child's current social and life skills
- Understanding triggers and patterns in behavioral responses
- Documenting both strengths and areas for growth without judgment
- Planning for teaching moments rather than punitive responses
