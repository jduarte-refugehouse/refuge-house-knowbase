## PURPOSE:

To establish a comprehensive, trauma-informed approach to initial assessments of children and youth admitted to Refuge House foster homes, ensuring all regulatory requirements are met while integrating Trust-Based Relational Intervention (TBRI®) principles throughout the assessment process. The assessment serves as the foundation for understanding each child's unique strengths, needs, and experiences of trauma, enabling the development of individualized, healing-centered service plans.

## BACKGROUND:

Refuge House recognizes that every child entering care has experienced relational trauma through separation from their family of origin and potentially other traumatic experiences. Our admission assessment process is designed to gather essential information while building trust and establishing the foundation for healing relationships. By integrating TBRI® principles from the moment of admission, we create an environment of felt safety that supports accurate assessment and effective service planning.

## POLICY:

Refuge House utilizes a cooperative, trauma-informed approach to the development of the Admission Assessment, taking into consideration valuable resources of information from CPS, previous foster agencies, and any other invested entities. The assessment process incorporates the three core TBRI® principles \- Connecting, Empowering, and Correcting \- to ensure that children feel safe, valued, and understood throughout the evaluation process.

Refuge House utilizes a strengths-based approach to the development of the Admission Assessment while ensuring that characteristics unique to each child are emphasized to focus on integrating the child into the family in a way that guides the development of the child's service/permanency plan, goals, engagement in services, and overall care. Through the lens of TBRI®, we recognize that all behavior has meaning and seek to understand the needs being communicated through both adaptive and maladaptive behaviors.

## TBRI® INTEGRATION IN ASSESSMENT:

### Connecting Principles in Assessment

The admission assessment process prioritizes building trust and connection by:

- Conducting assessments in environments where children feel safe and comfortable  
- Using warm, accepting tone and body language during all interactions  
- Allowing children to have a trusted person present during assessment activities  
- Beginning with strengths and interests before exploring challenging topics  
- Respecting the child's pace and readiness to share information  
- Recognizing that trust must be earned before children will share their full story

### Empowering Principles in Assessment

The assessment addresses physiological and environmental needs by evaluating:

- Current and historical patterns of eating, sleeping, and hydration  
- Sensory processing preferences and sensitivities  
- Physical activity needs and preferences  
- Environmental factors that promote or hinder felt safety  
- Medical conditions that may impact behavior or emotional regulation  
- Need for predictable routines and transitions

### Correcting Principles in Assessment

The assessment identifies opportunities for growth and skill-building by:

- Viewing challenging behaviors as survival skills that can be redirected  
- Identifying proactive strategies that have been successful in the past  
- Assessing the child's current social and life skills  
- Understanding triggers and patterns in behavioral responses  
- Documenting both strengths and areas for growth without judgment  
- Planning for teaching moments rather than punitive responses

## PACKAGE-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:

### CORE REQUIREMENTS

1. **Placement Types and Assessment Timelines**  
     
   A child/young adult may be placed in a Refuge House foster home in one of two ways:  
     
   - **Emergency Placement** – for a child/young adult who is newly placed in state custody and requires immediate placement  
   - **Routine Placement** – for a child/young adult who has been in state custody and requires new placement

   

2. **Communication Standards**  
     
   Refuge House does not have contact or direct working relationships with the biological family members of children in the agency's care. All contact with biological family members is conducted through DFPS/SSCC as appropriate.  
     
3. **Assessment Completion Requirements**  
     
   The admission assessment must be completed in accordance with regulatory timelines specified in TAC §749.1301. Each assessment must gather comprehensive information about the child's strengths, needs, trauma history, and current functioning to develop an effective service plan.

### ☑ Mental and Behavioral Health Support Services

1. **Comprehensive Clinical Assessment Requirements**  
     
   For children receiving Mental and Behavioral Health Support Services, the admission assessment must include enhanced evaluation of mental health history and treatment needs. This comprehensive clinical assessment examines:  
     
   - Previous psychiatric hospitalizations and residential treatment  
   - Current and past psychotropic medications and their effectiveness  
   - History of therapeutic interventions and treatment modalities  
   - Specific behavioral patterns and triggers  
   - Trauma history with particular attention to complex trauma presentations

   

   The assessment must align with the agency's Mental and Behavioral Health Support Services Treatment Model and incorporate evidence-based screening tools appropriate for identifying emotional, conduct, and behavioral disorders as defined in the DSM-5. Results from the CANS 3.0 Assessment (if completed prior to admission) must be integrated into the admission assessment to inform initial service planning.

   

2. **Behavioral Support Assessment**  
     
   Children in the Mental and Behavioral Health package require detailed behavioral assessment that identifies:  
     
   - Specific behavioral presentations requiring intervention  
   - Environmental factors that escalate or de-escalate behaviors  
   - Previous successful behavioral interventions  
   - Need for individualized behavior support plans  
   - Capacity of the foster family to implement therapeutic behavioral strategies

   

   The assessment must evaluate the child's readiness for community-based therapeutic services and identify any barriers to accessing mental health treatment. Documentation must include specific recommendations for the frequency and type of therapy services needed, with consideration for individual, family, and group therapy modalities as appropriate.

   

3. **Crisis Response Planning**  
     
   The admission assessment for Mental and Behavioral Health placements must include development of an initial crisis response plan. This involves identifying:  
     
   - Early warning signs of emotional dysregulation  
   - Previous crisis interventions and their effectiveness  
   - Specific de-escalation strategies that work for the child  
   - Safety planning for high-risk behaviors  
   - Coordination protocols with the 24/7 crisis response team

   

   Assessment must document any contraindications for specific interventions and establish clear communication pathways between the foster family, case management team, and mental health providers to ensure coordinated crisis response when needed.

### ☑ Intellectual or Developmental Disability (IDD)/Autism Spectrum Disorder Support Services

1. **Developmental and Functional Assessment**  
     
   Children receiving IDD/Autism Support Services require specialized assessment that evaluates developmental functioning across all domains. The admission assessment must include:  
     
   - Review of previous developmental evaluations and diagnoses  
   - Current adaptive functioning levels in daily living skills  
   - Communication abilities and preferred communication methods  
   - Sensory processing differences and accommodation needs  
   - Behavioral patterns related to developmental disabilities

   

   The assessment must incorporate information from educational evaluations, including current IEP or special education services, to ensure continuity of developmental support. Documentation should identify specific skill-building opportunities and areas where the child may need ongoing support to maximize independence.

   

2. **Communication and Social Assessment**  
     
   For children with IDD/Autism, the assessment must thoroughly evaluate communication needs and capabilities. This includes assessing:  
     
   - Expressive and receptive language abilities  
   - Use of alternative or augmentative communication systems  
   - Social communication differences and support needs  
   - Understanding of social cues and boundaries  
   - Strategies that enhance communication success

   

   The assessment should identify specific visual supports, structured routines, or environmental modifications that support the child's communication and social engagement. Foster families must be evaluated for their understanding and ability to implement these communication strategies consistently.

   

3. **Medical and Specialized Support Needs**  
     
   Children in the IDD/Autism package often have co-occurring medical conditions requiring specialized assessment. The admission assessment must document:  
     
   - Any seizure disorders and management protocols  
   - Feeding or swallowing difficulties requiring special diets  
   - Mobility or physical therapy needs  
   - Medication regimens requiring precise administration  
   - Need for specialized medical equipment or adaptive devices

   

   The assessment must verify the foster family's capacity to manage complex medical needs and their access to Registered Nurse consultation as required by the service package. Documentation should include specific medical training needs for foster parents and protocols for coordinating with multiple medical specialists.

   

4. **Environmental and Routine Assessment**  
     
   Children with IDD/Autism often require specific environmental considerations for successful placement. The assessment must evaluate:  
     
   - The child's need for predictable routines and structured environments  
   - Sensory sensitivities requiring environmental modifications  
   - Specific safety considerations related to elopement or self-injury  
   - Need for visual schedules or other organizational supports  
   - Capacity for transitions and changes in routine

   

   The assessment should document successful strategies used in previous placements and provide specific recommendations for environmental setup and daily routine structuring to support the child's developmental needs.
