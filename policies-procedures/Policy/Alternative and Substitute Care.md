## PURPOSE:

To establish a standardized process that allows caregivers to utilize alternative and substitute care options while ensuring children and youth in care receive consistent, trauma-informed supervision that meets their individual needs and complies with all regulatory requirements.

## POLICY:

Refuge House recognizes that caregivers of foster/adoptive children need periodic breaks from the normal routine to allow time to recharge and refresh. Refuge House encourages caregivers to plan times when they can utilize these breaks to provide continued quality care to the children/young adults placed in their homes. Refuge House offers alternative and substitute care options while ensuring all RCCL minimum standards, DFPS/SSCC Contract terms, and T3C Blueprint requirements are followed according to the type of occurrence. All substitute care providers will be familiar with trauma-informed approaches and the basic TBRI principles to ensure continuity of care and minimize disruption for children in placement.

## PACKAGE-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:

### CORE REQUIREMENTS

1. Refuge House offers two primary ways for a caregiver to take advantage of regular and routine breaks prior to becoming overwhelmed by their care giving duties:  
     
   - IAC (Intermittent Alternative Care)  
   - Babysitting (for shorter periods)

   

2. All alternative and substitute care arrangements require verification that the provider can meet the child/young adult's needs while in their care, including consideration of:  
     
   - Medication regimen  
   - Medical, dental, psychological or psychiatric appointments  
   - Court ordered visitation  
   - Educational needs  
   - Recreational schedule  
   - Level of supervision required  
   - Daily routines and dietary issues  
   - Diagnosis and level of care  
   - History and potential trauma triggers  
   - Cultural, racial, ethnic, linguistic, religious, and sexual orientation considerations

   

3. A CPMS qualified employee must approve the child/young adult's stay prior to each occurrence, ensuring compliance with child/caregiver capacity ratios and geographic proximity requirements.  
     
4. For a child/young adult associated with a tribe, Refuge House will contact the tribal representative for approvals for IAC. A dedicated tribal liaison contact protocol and ICWA-compliant placement checklist will be maintained and followed for all tribal youth.  
     
5. All substitute care providers must be screened for physical, emotional, and mental stability to provide safe, quality care for youth.
