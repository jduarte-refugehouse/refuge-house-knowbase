## PURPOSE

To establish comprehensive policies and procedures for delivering Intellectual or Developmental Disability (IDD)/Autism Spectrum Disorder Support Services as defined by the T3C System Blueprint, ensuring children with IDD or Autism diagnoses receive specialized developmental, behavioral, and medical supports through evidence-informed treatment models.

## POLICY

Refuge House shall provide IDD/Autism Spectrum Disorder Support Services that address the unique developmental, communication, sensory, and medical needs of children with intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorders. This specialized service package recognizes that children with IDD/Autism require structured environments, specialized communication strategies, and coordinated medical care to achieve their fullest potential.

The foundation of our IDD/Autism Services incorporates Trust-Based Relational Intervention® (TBRI) adapted for developmental differences, ensuring all interactions respect neurodiversity while promoting skill development and independence. Services are supervised by qualified Treatment Directors with expertise in developmental disabilities and coordinated with registered nursing services for medical complexity.

This umbrella policy aggregates all requirements and references existing Refuge House policies that collectively support implementation of this T3C Service Package.

- Medical consultation for complex health needs  
- Medication management oversight  
- Medical equipment troubleshooting  
- Health status monitoring  
- Emergency medical guidance

RN services may be provided through employed nurses, contracted nursing services, or established telehealth/nurse line arrangements that ensure immediate access.

**RN Access Protocol:**

- **Who Calls:** Foster parents for medical questions; case managers and clinical staff for care plan consultation  
- **Documentation:** All RN consultations logged in child's medical record within 24 hours

### 2.3 Therapeutic Service Delivery

Licensed therapy services for children with IDD/Autism focus on developmental and behavioral interventions. Therapists must:

- Demonstrate expertise in developmental disabilities  
- Utilize evidence-based interventions for IDD/Autism  
- Adapt therapeutic approaches for communication differences  
- Coordinate with educational and medical providers

The therapy team works closely with speech, occupational, and physical therapists when these services are indicated.

**Therapy Coordination Requirements:**

All therapeutic services require systematic coordination to ensure quality and continuity:

- **Therapist Credential Verification:** Case Manager reviews therapist credentials and verifies IDD/Autism experience through credential review, references, or work history before first session  
- **STAR Health Authorization:** Submit authorization requests within 5 business days of service need identification, including clinical justification referencing IDD/Autism diagnosis and functional need  
- **Authorization Tracking:** Monitor authorization status weekly until approved; maintain current authorization list in child's file  
- **Progress Monitoring:** Obtain monthly progress reports from therapist and integrate into Service Plan updates  
- **Schedule Coordination:** Coordinate therapy schedule with foster parent, school, and other service providers to minimize disruption and maximize benefit  
- **Service Denials:** Upon denial, notify SSCC/DFPS and Regional Well-being Specialist within 3 business days; file expedited appeal if service is therapeutically necessary

### 2.4 Behavioral Support Infrastructure

Behavioral Support Specialists/Mentors serving children with IDD/Autism require specialized training in:

- Positive behavior support for developmental disabilities  
- Alternative and augmentative communication  
- Sensory integration strategies  
- Structured teaching methods  
- Daily living skills instruction

These services maintain a 1:15 ratio while providing intensive support for skill development and community integration.

### 2.5 Crisis Management Capability

Crisis response for children with IDD/Autism requires understanding that behavioral escalations often represent communication attempts or sensory overload. Crisis Management Staff must:

- Recognize developmental triggers  
- Utilize sensory-based calming strategies  
- Understand communication frustrations  
- Implement least restrictive interventions  
- Coordinate with medical providers for health-related behaviors

**IDD/Autism Crisis Response Protocol:**

Before implementing behavioral intervention during a crisis, crisis staff must follow developmental disability-adapted protocol:

1. **Medical Screening (First Priority):**  
     
   - Contact RN consultant via 24/7 line to rule out medical causes  
   - Assess for pain indicators (change in typical behavior, guarding body parts, facial expressions)  
   - Check for illness signs (fever, vomiting, diarrhea, recent medication changes)  
   - Review medication administration log for timing and potential side effects  
   - Document medical screening in crisis report before proceeding

   

2. **Sensory Assessment (Second Priority):**  
     
   - Move child to quiet, low-stimulation space if safe to do so  
   - Reduce sensory input (dim lights, minimize noise, remove audience)  
   - Assess for sensory overload indicators (covering ears, avoiding eye contact, withdrawal)  
   - Offer sensory regulation tools from child's individualized toolkit

   

3. **Communication Support (Third Priority):**  
     
   - Use simplified language (5 words or less)  
   - Offer visual choices rather than verbal questions  
   - Allow extended processing time (10-30 seconds between communications)  
   - Check for communication breakdown (child unable to express need, frustration with AAC device)

   

4. **Environmental Review (Fourth Priority):**  
     
   - Identify recent schedule changes or disruptions to routine  
   - Check for unexpected transitions or canceled activities  
   - Assess for changes in familiar caregivers or settings  
   - Return to predictable routine when possible

   

5. **Behavioral Intervention (Final Step):**  
     
   - Only after medical, sensory, communication, and environmental factors addressed  
   - Implement least restrictive intervention appropriate to developmental level  
   - Follow individualized crisis response plan  
   - Maintain calm, non-threatening presence

**Crisis Documentation:**

All crisis incidents must document:

- Medical screening completed (RN consultation logged)  
- Sensory factors identified and addressed  
- Communication strategies attempted  
- Environmental triggers noted  
- Interventions implemented and child's response  
- Follow-up plan to prevent recurrence

### 2.6 Foster Parent Preparation

Foster parents caring for children with IDD/Autism require specialized preparation before accepting placements. The comprehensive training program ensures caregivers understand developmental differences, communication needs, behavioral strategies, and medical coordination requirements.

**Pre-Placement Training Requirements:**

Before accepting IDD/Autism placements, foster parents must complete minimum specialized training:

- **IDD/Autism Characteristics** (minimum 2 hours): Understanding intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorders, recognizing developmental differences, neurodiversity principles

- **Behavior Management for Developmental Disabilities** (minimum 2 hours): Positive behavior support, understanding behavior as communication, sensory considerations, de-escalation strategies adapted for developmental differences  
- **Medical Needs and RN Coordination** (minimum 1 hour): When to consult RN, medication administration for complex regimens, medical equipment basics, coordinating with medical providers  
- **Crisis Prevention and Response** (minimum 1 hour): Recognizing developmental triggers, sensory-based calming strategies, differentiating medical vs. behavioral crises, implementing least restrictive interventions

**Total Minimum Requirement:** 8 hours IDD/Autism-specific training

**Documentation Requirements:**

- Training attendance verified via sign-in sheets  
- Certificates of completion maintained in foster parent file  
- Competency assessment completed before first placement  
- Annual refresher training (minimum 4 hours) for ongoing placements

**Placement-Specific Training:**

Upon matching with specific child, foster parents receive additional individualized training on:

- Child's specific communication methods and preferences
