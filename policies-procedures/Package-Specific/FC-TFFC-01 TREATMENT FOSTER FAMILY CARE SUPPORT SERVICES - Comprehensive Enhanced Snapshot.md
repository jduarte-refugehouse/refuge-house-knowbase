- Therapy type selection matches CANS-identified needs (individual, family, group, specialized modalities)
- Therapy frequency determined by CANS severity and complexity (weekly minimum, may increase based on clinical need)
- Crisis risk domains inform safety planning and on-call therapist protocols

**At Each 60-Day Service Plan Review:**
- Compare current CANS 3.0 to previous assessment(s)
- Analyze CANS changes to evaluate intensive intervention effectiveness
- Adjust therapy type based on domain-specific progress or challenges
- Modify therapy frequency based on clinical response and CANS trajectory
- Assess step-down readiness using CANS improvement across multiple domains

**CANS-Driven Service Adjustments:**
- **Increased therapy frequency:** When CANS shows minimal improvement or regression despite current therapy
- **Addition of specialized modalities:** When CANS reveals specific needs requiring targeted intervention
- **Family therapy intensification:** When CANS indicates caregiver stress or family dysfunction hindering progress
- **Step-down initiation:** When CANS demonstrates sustained improvement allowing transition to less-restrictive package
- **Continued TFFC justification:** CANS data supports continued need for intensive services in Continued Stay reviews
