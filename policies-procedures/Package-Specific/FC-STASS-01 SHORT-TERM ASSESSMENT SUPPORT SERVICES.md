# POLICY SECTIONS

## 1. PURPOSE AND SERVICE PACKAGE DESCRIPTION

### 1.1 Purpose

This policy establishes Refuge House's commitment to providing trauma-informed, assessment-focused foster care services under the T3C Short-Term Assessment Support Services Package.

### 1.2 Service Package Description

The Short-Term Assessment Support Services Package provides a trauma-informed foster home that, in addition to providing a child's basic living needs (food, clothing, shelter, education, vocation, transportation, recreation, and extracurricular needs), provides short-term coordination of comprehensive assessments and evaluations.

**Eligible Population:** Children, youth, and young adults who present as:
- New to care, or transitioning from an unpaid placement, where more information is needed to understand custom service needs; OR
- Returning to foster care after an unauthorized absence or unauthorized placement; OR
- Transitioning based on a recent, unplanned disruption in placement; AND
- In need of further assessment(s) and evaluation(s) to identify an appropriate Service Package and subsequent placement

### 1.3 Add-On Services Exclusion

**CRITICAL:** This Service Package is NOT eligible for any Add-On Services including Transition Support Services, Kinship Caregiver Support Services, or Pregnant & Parenting Youth Support Services.

---

## 2. GOVERNING PRINCIPLES

### 2.1 TBRI® Foundation

Refuge House implements Trust-Based Relational Intervention® (TBRI®) as our Evidence-informed Treatment Model, as established in **FC-T3C-01 T3C Basic Foster Family Home Support Services Policy** and detailed in our **TBRI Treatment Model Executive Summary**. For Short-Term Assessment Services, TBRI principles are adapted to support accurate assessment while building trust:

**Connecting Principles:** Building trust quickly through attentive, nurturing care that communicates safety during a transitional period.

**Empowering Principles:** Addressing physical and environmental needs that support accurate assessment, including sensory processing, nutrition, and sleep regulation.

**Correcting Principles:** Using proactive and responsive strategies that provide structure while allowing authentic behavior observation for assessment purposes.

### 2.2 Assessment-Centered Approach

Our approach recognizes that the assessment period itself is an intervention that begins the child's healing journey. Foster families play a critical role in observing and documenting child behavior and needs.
