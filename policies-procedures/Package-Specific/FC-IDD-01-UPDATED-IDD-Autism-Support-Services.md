# POLICY SECTIONS

## 1. PURPOSE AND SERVICE PACKAGE DESCRIPTION

### 1.1 Service Package Definition

IDD/Autism Spectrum Disorder Support Services provides specialized foster care for children, youth, and young adults with intellectual disabilities or autism spectrum disorders who require developmental, behavioral, and medical supports through evidence-informed treatment models.

### 1.2 Target Population

Children, youth, and young adults who:

- Have a formal diagnosis of Intellectual Disability (mild, moderate, severe, or profound)
- Have Autism Spectrum Disorder at any level requiring support
- Have Pervasive Developmental Disorder
- Have other developmental disabilities significantly impacting adaptive functioning

### 1.3 Service Package Objectives

- Provide stable foster home environment with specialized developmental supports
- Coordinate comprehensive developmental and therapeutic services
- Support skill development and independence appropriate to developmental level
- Integrate family engagement in care coordination
- Provide educational coordination including IEP/ARD advocacy

### 1.4 Dual Credentialing Requirement

In addition to maintaining the IDD/Autism Spectrum Disorder Support Services Package credential, the Child Placing Agency and Foster Family Home Caregivers must be Credentialed to provide the T3C Basic Foster Family Home Support Service Package. This allows for step-down within the same foster family home when the SSCC or DFPS determines the child no longer requires the level of intervention and services inherent in the IDD/Autism package.
