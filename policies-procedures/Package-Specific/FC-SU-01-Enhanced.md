## 2. GOVERNING PRINCIPLES

### 2.1 TBRI® Integration

> **📋 DERIVED FROM: TBRI Treatment Model Executive Summary**
>
> Refuge House's Evidence-informed Treatment Model applies Trust-Based Relational Intervention (TBRI®) principles across all Service Packages. For Substance Use Support Services:
>
> **Connecting Principles:** Build trusting relationships that support recovery; recognize that substance use often stems from unmet attachment needs and trauma.
>
> **Empowering Principles:** Address physical needs that may trigger substance use; ensure proper nutrition, sleep, and sensory regulation support recovery.
>
> **Correcting Principles:** Respond to substance-related behaviors with understanding rather than punishment; use TBRI® de-escalation during substance-related crises.

### 2.2 Recovery-Focused Approach

All services are delivered through a recovery lens that:
- Views recovery as a process, not an event
- Addresses underlying trauma contributing to substance use
- Builds on youth strengths and protective factors
- Engages family and natural supports in recovery
- Provides non-punitive response to setbacks

### 2.3 Non-Punitive Philosophy

**CRITICAL:** Substance use and relapse are addressed as clinical events requiring treatment adjustment, NOT as behavioral infractions warranting punitive response. This principle applies to:
- Drug screening results
- Relapse incidents
- Disclosure of substance use
- All substance-related crises
