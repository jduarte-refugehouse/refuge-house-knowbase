## PURPOSE

To establish Refuge House's commitment to providing trauma-informed, assessment-focused foster care services under the T3C Short-Term Assessment Support Services Package. This time-limited service coordinates comprehensive evaluations to determine appropriate ongoing service needs and placement.

## POLICY

Refuge House provides Short-Term Assessment Support Services through credentialed foster homes using Trust-Based Relational Intervention® (TBRI®) as our Evidence-informed Treatment Model. This package serves children who require comprehensive evaluation to identify appropriate Service Package placement, including those new to care, returning after unauthorized absence, or transitioning after placement disruption.
