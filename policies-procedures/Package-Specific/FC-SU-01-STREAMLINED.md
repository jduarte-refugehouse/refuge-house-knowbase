## PURPOSE

To establish Refuge House's commitment to providing trauma-informed, recovery-focused foster care services under the T3C Substance Use Support Services Package. This package addresses children and youth with substance use disorders or those at significant risk, providing comprehensive assessment, treatment coordination, and recovery support.

## POLICY

Refuge House provides Substance Use Support Services through credentialed foster homes using Trust-Based Relational Intervention® (TBRI®) as our Evidence-informed Treatment Model, integrated with evidence-based substance use treatment principles. This package serves children requiring specialized support for substance-related challenges within a therapeutic foster home environment.

**Recovery Philosophy:** Refuge House recognizes that recovery is possible for all youth, that relapse is addressed as an opportunity for treatment adjustment rather than failure, and that trauma-informed care addresses root causes of substance use.
