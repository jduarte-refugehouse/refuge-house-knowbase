### 1.1 Setting and Permit Requirements

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Short-Term Assessment Support Services p.69 (October 2025)

| **Setting** | Foster Family Home |
| **Permit Type** | Child Placing Agency |

### 1.2 Service Package Description

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Short-Term Assessment Support Services p.69 (October 2025)

A trauma-informed foster home that, in addition to providing a child's basic living needs including food, clothing, shelter, education, vocation, transportation, recreation, and extracurricular needs, provides short-term coordination of comprehensive assessments and evaluations for children, youth, and young adults who may present as:

- **New to care**, or transitioning from an unpaid placement, and where more information is needed to understand the child's custom service need(s); **or**
- **Returning** to foster care after an unauthorized absence or unauthorized placement; **or**
- **Transitioning** based on a recent, unplanned disruption in placement; **and**
- **In need** of further assessment(s) and evaluation(s) to identify an appropriate Service Package and subsequent placement.

The Short-Term Assessment Support Services Package is designed to offer community-based care, assessment, and treatment services for children, youth, and young adults based on their individual strengths and needs, and in accordance with their customized Service Plan and permanency goal.

### 1.3 Refuge House Implementation

Refuge House provides Short-Term Assessment Support Services through credentialed foster family homes in Dallas and San Antonio. Our TBRI-based approach ensures that the assessment period itself is an intervention that begins the child's healing journey, while simultaneously gathering comprehensive information to inform appropriate Service Package placement.

---

## 2. GOVERNING PRINCIPLES

### 2.1 Treatment Model Foundation

> **📋 DERIVED FROM: TBRI Treatment Model Executive Summary**
>
> For Short-Term Assessment, TBRI principles guide all interactions during the assessment period:
>
> **Connecting Principles:** Building trust during short-term placement while gathering assessment information.
>
> **Empowering Principles:** Meeting immediate physical and emotional needs while coordinating evaluations.
>
> **Correcting Principles:** Responding to behaviors with understanding, recognizing children may have unknown trauma history.

### 2.2 Assessment-Centered Approach

This package recognizes that accurate assessment informs appropriate placement. The focus is on gathering comprehensive information to support the best Service Package match. Foster families play a critical role in observing and documenting child behavior and needs throughout the assessment period.

### 2.3 Not Eligible for Add-On Services

**CRITICAL:** Short-Term Assessment Support Services is NOT eligible for Add-On Services per T3C Blueprint p.69 (October 2025). The time-limited, assessment-focused nature of this package does not align with the ongoing support services provided through Add-On packages.

---

### 3.3 CANS 3.0 Assessment Alignment

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Short-Term Assessment Support Services p.76 (October 2025)

Placement type and Service Package must align with the child's needs and strengths as demonstrated through the CANS 3.0 Assessment (once administered), Application for Placement, and/or based on the knowledge and professional judgment of the child's Service Planning team.

**Note:** For Short-Term Assessment, CANS 3.0 may not yet be administered at time of admission. The assessment itself is a primary function of this Service Package.

### 3.4 Pre-Placement Visit

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Short-Term Assessment Support Services p.76 (October 2025)

A Pre-Placement visit must be conducted when applicable and appropriate, and must be successful. Given the nature of Short-Term Assessment referrals (often urgent), pre-placement visits may not always be feasible.

### 3.5 Admissions Staff Review

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Short-Term Assessment Support Services p.76-77 (October 2025)

Refuge House admissions staff must review the child's information and determine that the child's needs align with services offered by Refuge House and selected Caregivers.

### 3.6 Dual Credentialing Requirement

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Short-Term Assessment Support Services p.77 (October 2025)

Both Refuge House (as the Child Placing Agency) and the Foster Family Home must be Credentialed to provide the Short-Term Assessment Support Services Package.

### 3.7 Capacity Limitation

**Maximum 4 children** in foster care per home, unless necessary to accommodate placement of a sibling group (per T3C Blueprint p.70, October 2025).

### 3.8 SSCC/DFPS Referral Coordination

>
> | Who | How | When |
> | :---- | :---- | :---- |
> | Intake/Placement Coordinator | 1. Receive referral from SSCC or DFPS<br>2. Determines need for assessment placement<br>3. Provides all available information<br>4. Identifies assessment priorities | Before placement |
> | Treatment Director | 1. Reviews referral information<br>2. Confirms assessment feasibility within timeline<br>3. Approves or recommends alternative | Within 4 hours |
> | Case Manager | 1. Coordinates admission<br>2. Begins assessment scheduling immediately | Upon approval |

**Ongoing Communication:**

- 10-day notice before maximum stay date with preliminary Service Package recommendation
- Final Service Package recommendation with comprehensive justification at discharge

### 3.9 Foster Family Home Availability

Foster Family Home must be available for admission at the time of placement match.

### 3.10 Quality Assurance for Admissions

| Who | How | When |
|-----|-----|------|

- 95% of placements complete within standard timeline (without extension)
- 100% of discharges include Service Package recommendation

---

## 4. LENGTH OF SERVICE PARAMETERS

### 4.1 Time-Limited Nature

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Short-Term Assessment Support Services p.74 (October 2025)

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:** Short-Term Assessment Support Services is the ONLY T3C Service Package with strict, non-negotiable maximum timelines. This package is designed for assessment to determine appropriate ongoing Service Package, NOT for long-term placement.

### 4.2 Standard Length of Service

| Child Age | Standard Assessment Period | Extension Available | Absolute Maximum |
|-----------|---------------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Age 5 and under** | **30 days** | One 15-day extension | **45 days total** |
| **Over age 5** | **45 days** | One 15-day extension | **60 days total** |

**These are MAXIMUM timelines, not targets.** The goal is to complete assessments and make Service Package determination as quickly as feasible.

### 4.3 Anticipated Length of Service

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Short-Term Assessment Support Services p.74 (October 2025)

Although maximum Length of Service guidelines are established, Refuge House policy includes an anticipated Length of Service for children, youth, and young adults served under the Short-Term Assessment Support Services Package.

#### 4.3.1 Basis for Anticipated Length of Service

The anticipated Length of Service is individualized for each child and is based on:

- The **number and complexity of assessments** required to make an informed Service Package recommendation
- The child's **age** (which determines the 30-day or 45-day standard timeline)
- **Assessment scheduling availability** and any known barriers to timely completion
- The child's **behavioral and emotional stability** during the assessment period
- The **CANS 3.0 Assessment results** (once administered)
- The **Treatment Model** for providing Short-Term Assessment Support Services
- The **Admission Guidelines** and assessment priorities identified at intake

#### 4.3.2 What the CPA Must Include

Refuge House's anticipated Length of Service for each child must include:

- **Anticipated duration** expressed in specific days or weeks (not to exceed the established maximums of 30/45 days without extension)
- **Target assessment completion timeline** identifying milestones for each required assessment
- **Service Package recommendation target date** for when the determination is expected to be complete
- **Extension eligibility notation** if it appears assessments may require additional time beyond the standard period

**Anticipated Standard Completion:** Within 80% of the maximum timeline. The goal is to complete assessments and Service Package recommendation as quickly as feasible.

### 4.4 Extension Process

When assessments cannot be completed within the standard timeline:

| Who | How | When |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Case Manager | 1. Document assessment progress and barriers<br>2. Request extension from Program Director<br>3. Document written justification | Before initial timeline expires |
| Program Director | 1. Review progress and barriers<br>2. Approve or deny extension<br>3. Document decision | Before initial timeline expires |

**Extension Justification Examples:**
- Youth behavioral challenges delaying valid assessment
- Required assessments delayed due to provider availability
- Medical issues interfering with assessment completion
- Additional time needed for accurate developmental evaluation

## 5. SERVICE PACKAGE EXPECTATIONS

### 5.1 Assessment Coordination

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Short-Term Assessment Support Services p.70 (October 2025)

**Primary Focus:** Coordinating comprehensive assessments, evaluations, screenings, and treatment services.

| Assessment Timeline | Age Group | Regulatory Reference |
|--------------------|-----------|---------------------|
| Within **21 days** of admission | Children aged 5 and under | T3C Blueprint p.70 |
| Within **30 days** of admission | Children aged 6 and older | T3C Blueprint p.70 |

Assessments are based on the child's individual needs. Services that are eligible should be authorized and paid through STAR Health. Authorization requests will be sent to STAR Health as needed for Medicaid-covered services. If services are Medicaid-covered services, providers must be credentialed and contracted with the STAR Health managed care organization.

### 5.2 Service Planning Requirements

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Short-Term Assessment Support Services p.70 (October 2025)

Service Planning team meetings must occur in accordance with the provider's Treatment Model and based on the child's needs and permanency plan, but a Service Plan review must occur at least once **every 30 days**.

#### 5.2.1 Service Plan Content and Development

As informed by the child (if appropriate), youth or young adult, and in collaboration with the Service Planning team, the Service Plan must include:

- **Customized goals** developed with meaningful input from the child/youth that reflect their strengths, needs, and assessment priorities
- **Planned services and supports** specifically identified to help achieve each goal
- **Documentation of who informed the Service Plan**, including the child/youth (when age-appropriate), Service Planning team members, Foster Family Home Caregivers, SSCC/DFPS caseworker, biological family/support persons (when safe and appropriate), educational representatives, and medical providers (as applicable)

The Service Planning team incorporates input from all relevant parties to develop assessment-focused goals that guide the Service Package determination process.

#### 5.2.2 Service Plan Review - Progress Documentation

Service Plan reviews must include documentation to show the progress made toward achieving **each goal**. For each goal identified in the Service Plan, the review documents:

- **Current status** of goal achievement (no progress, minimal progress, moderate progress, significant progress, goal achieved)
- **Specific examples** demonstrating current functioning related to the goal
- **Effective interventions and supports** that have promoted progress
- **Barriers to progress** and challenges encountered
- **Adjustments needed** to services, supports, or the goal itself
- **Assessment coordination progress** specific to STASS timeline requirements

**Review Frequency:** Every **30 days** for Short-Term Assessment (reflects accelerated timeline and assessment focus).

> **📋 DERIVED FROM: FC3-01.1 Individual Service Planning Procedure**
>
> For Short-Term Assessment, Service Plan goals focus primarily on:
> - Supporting the assessment process and assessment coordination progress
> - Preparing for transition to the receiving Service Package
> - Service Package recommendation development

### 5.3 Treatment Model Requirements

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Short-Term Assessment Support Services p.70-71 (October 2025)

Evidence-informed Treatment Model(s) that incorporates trauma-informed care for children that have been the victim of abuse and/or neglect. The Treatment Model must include specific programming designed to meet the custom needs of children, youth, and young adults with varying service needs as the process of assessment is completed.

The Treatment Model should be practiced throughout the operation and used as the basis to form all policy, procedures, and practices related to this Service Package. Children, youth, and young adults must be aware of, and all staff and Caregivers providing these services must be trained in, practice, and remain current with, delivery of the Treatment Model.

**Refuge House Implementation:** TBRI (Trust-Based Relational Intervention) serves as the foundational Treatment Model, enhanced with evidence-based practices including PBIS and trauma-informed interventions. See Section 17 for detailed application.

### 5.4 Logic Model Requirement

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Short-Term Assessment Support Services p.71 (October 2025)

Refuge House must maintain a current Logic Model specific to the provision of the Short-Term Assessment Support Services Package, which is modified over time based on the CQI process.

**Cross-Reference:** CQI Plan - Logic Model Implementation

### 5.5 24/7 Crisis Availability

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Short-Term Assessment Support Services p.71 (October 2025)

Due to the varying needs of children, youth, and young adults eligible for this Service Package, Refuge House must have case manager level or above staff available 24 hours a day/7 days a week to respond in person, or by phone or video conference to any crisis that arises.

**Cross-Reference:** Crisis response per **FC-04 Crisis Management Policy** and **FC-04.1 Crisis Management Procedure Section 5**

**CRITICAL CONSIDERATION:** Children in Short-Term Assessment often have unknown histories, requiring heightened vigilance and enhanced documentation.

| Assessment Period Crisis Requirement | Protocol | Reference |
|-------------------------------------|----------|-----------|
| Unknown History Approach | Assume potential trauma; use TBRI de-escalation | FC-04.1 Section 5.2 |
| Expedited Personal Safety Plan | Within 72 hours of placement (vs. standard timeline) | FC-04.1 Section 5.3 |
| Enhanced Crisis Documentation | Document ALL interventions (effective and ineffective) for transition | FC-04.1 Section 5.4 |
| Transition Crisis Summary | Include crisis patterns in Service Package recommendation | FC-04.1 Section 5.5 |

### 5.6 CANS 3.0 Assessment

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Short-Term Assessment Support Services p.71 (October 2025)

The child's CANS 3.0 Assessment must be administered in accordance with requirements, but no later than:

| Age Group | CANS 3.0 Timeline |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Children between ages 3 and 5 | Within **21 days** of entering placement |
| Children aged 6 and older | Within **30 days** of entering placement |

#### 5.6.1 How CANS 3.0 Results Are Used

Results of the CANS 3.0 Assessment must be used to:

- **Inform the customized Service Plan** by identifying areas of strength and need that shape individualized assessment-focused goals
- **Guide the Service Package recommendation** for placement beyond the current Short-Term Assessment, by identifying the level of service intensity and specialization needed (e.g., Mental & Behavioral Health, IDD/Autism, Substance Use, Basic Foster Home)
- **Identify areas requiring specialized assessment** or evaluation that may not yet have been completed during the assessment window
- **Establish baseline functioning** that will serve as a comparison point for the receiving placement's future CANS 3.0 reassessments
- **Inform immediate intervention and support needs** during the remainder of the Short-Term Assessment period

**Note:** For Short-Term Assessment, CANS 3.0 ongoing reassessment is generally not applicable due to the time-limited placement duration (30-45 days). If placement extends beyond 90 days with an approved extension, CANS 3.0 should be readministered.

### 5.7 Human Trafficking Prevention

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Short-Term Assessment Support Services p.71 (October 2025)

> **📋 DERIVED FROM: FC-HT-01 Human Trafficking Prevention Policy**
>
> Universal Human Trafficking Prevention Training is required for all staff and Caregivers. Children, youth, and young adults must receive information related to the prevention of Human Trafficking in accordance with Refuge House's documented and planned method.
>

Requests for specific services determined necessary as part of the Service Plan or Service Plan review, and for which the child, youth, or young adult is referred, and the service is not readily available and/or it is determined that the child, youth, or young adult is ineligible for the service, must be documented in the case record. This documentation shall include:

- The date the service request, application, or referral was made

#### 5.8.4 Community Resource Pursuit

Refuge House shall seek community resources to obtain any needed services that are not covered through STAR Health.

#### 5.8.5 Cost Coverage Commitment

**If community resources are not available and/or STAR Health does not cover the needed service(s) consistent with this Service Package, and as outlined in the Service Plan or Service Plan review, Refuge House will ensure delivery of, and cover the cost of the needed service(s) and related supports.**

**Cross-Reference:** FC-STAR-01.1 STAR Health Coordination Procedure Section 9 (Managing Service Denials and Access Barriers)

### 5.9 Educational Coordination

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Short-Term Assessment Support Services p.73 (October 2025)

This Service Package requires coordination and participation in school enrollment, including advocating for, and ensuring various educational testing and plans are completed as necessary, and accommodations and/or supports are in place to aid in the child's educational success.

Refuge House educational coordination for Short-Term Assessment includes:

- **School Enrollment:** Expedited enrollment in the appropriate school upon placement, including coordination with the school district's foster care liaison
- **Educational Testing:** Coordination of referrals for educational testing (academic, cognitive, behavioral) when indicated by the child's needs or when existing evaluations are outdated or unavailable
- **IEP/504 Plans:** Reviewing, requesting, and advocating for Individualized Education Programs (IEP) or Section 504 plans as indicated; ensuring the receiving school has current plans and documentation
- **Supports and Accommodations:** Ensuring appropriate educational supports and accommodations are in place during the assessment period, including tutoring, supplemental services, and classroom modifications as needed
- **Education Portfolio:** Compiling educational records, testing results, IEP/504 documentation, and school performance information for inclusion in the Transition Summary and Service Package recommendation

Given the short-term nature of placement, emphasis is on continuity of educational services, identification of educational needs, and comprehensive documentation for inclusion in the Service Package recommendation and transition to the receiving placement.

> **📋 DERIVED FROM: FC-T3C-01 Section on Educational Services**
>
> The Education Liaison or Case Manager coordinates all educational services during the assessment period, working with the child's school, SSCC/DFPS caseworker, and foster family to ensure educational stability and complete assessment of educational needs.

### 5.10 STAR Health Coordination

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Short-Term Assessment Support Services p.73 (October 2025)

Refuge House and Foster Family Home Caregivers are required to coordinate care with the child or youth's medical consenter and are required to participate in STAR Health Service Coordination (dependent on child, youth, or young adult's individual eligibility).

> **📋 DERIVED FROM: FC-STAR-01.1 STAR Health Coordination Procedure**
>
> STAR Health coordination for Short-Term Assessment includes expedited authorization for assessments and evaluations, with emphasis on completing all evaluations within the time-limited service window.

### 5.11 IT System Requirements

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Short-Term Assessment Support Services p.71 (October 2025)

Refuge House is required to have Information Technology (IT) System(s) that allows for data collection to support Quality Assurance, Continuous Quality Improvement, case management documentation, billing/invoicing, reporting, and child-level outcome tracking processes, as well as tracking outcomes for children, youth, and young adults at the foster home level.

The IT system must have the ability to track Short-Term Assessment Support Services Package referral, admission, and discharge data by child, youth, or young adult, broken out by:

- Referral source (whether SSCC or DFPS)
- Number and percentage of referrals that did and did not result in admission
- Reasons for denial of admissions based on referrals
- For children admitted: average Length of Service based on time from admission to discharge

> **📋 DERIVED FROM: IT Implementation Plan**
>

### 5.12 Insurance Requirements

Refuge House maintains Insurance in accordance with SSCC and/or DFPS contractual requirements.

### 5.13 Family Engagement

> **📋 DERIVED FROM: FC7-01 Family Connections and Engagement Policy**
>

### 5.14 Foster Family Home Caregiver Responsibilities

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Short-Term Assessment Support Services p.72 (October 2025)

#### 5.14.1 Enhanced Logistical Support

Foster Family Home Caregivers offer **enhanced** logistical support, transportation, coordination, and documentation/record keeping of assessments to inform needed services in accordance with court orders and the Service Plan. This enhanced level of support reflects the assessment-intensive nature of STASS placements, including:

- Transportation to and from all assessment appointments, evaluations, screenings, and treatment services
- Coordination with assessment providers regarding scheduling and follow-up
- Documentation and record keeping of all assessments completed, including dates, providers, and key findings
- Daily observation and documentation of the child's behavioral patterns, needs, and responses to interventions

## 17. TREATMENT MODEL APPLICATION

> **📋 DERIVED FROM: TBRI Treatment Model Executive Summary**
>
> For Short-Term Assessment, TBRI principles are adapted to support accurate assessment while building trust:
>
> **Connecting Principles:** Building trust quickly through attentive, nurturing care that communicates safety during a transitional period. For assessment purposes, genuine connection facilitates more accurate behavioral observation and assessment participation.
>
> **Empowering Principles:** Addressing physical and environmental needs that support accurate assessment, including sensory processing, nutrition, and sleep regulation. Meeting immediate needs allows the child to engage more authentically in the assessment process.
>
> **Correcting Principles:** Using proactive and responsive strategies that provide structure while allowing authentic behavior observation for assessment purposes. Correcting with TBRI principles ensures that behavioral data gathered during assessment reflects the child's actual needs rather than responses to punitive environments.
