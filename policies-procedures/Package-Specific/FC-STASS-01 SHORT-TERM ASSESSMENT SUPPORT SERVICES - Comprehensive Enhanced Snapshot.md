# POLICY SECTIONS

## 1. PURPOSE AND SERVICE PACKAGE DESCRIPTION

### 1.1 Service Package Definition

Short-Term Assessment Support Services is a T3C Service Package providing time-limited, assessment-focused foster care for children who require comprehensive evaluation to determine appropriate ongoing Service Package placement.

### 1.2 Target Population

Children, youth, and young adults who present as:

- **New to Care:** Newly entering foster care and requiring comprehensive assessment
- **Transitioning from Unpaid Placement:** Moving from kinship or other unpaid arrangement
- **Returning After Unauthorized Absence:** Returning to care after runaway
- **Post-Disruption:** Experienced recent unplanned placement disruption requiring reassessment

### 1.3 Assessment-Focused Philosophy

Refuge House recognizes that:

- The assessment period itself is an intervention that begins the child's healing journey
- Foster families play a critical role in observing and documenting child behavior and needs
- Comprehensive evaluation during this period informs appropriate Service Package placement
- Time-limited structure ensures efficient assessment completion and transition

### 1.4 Service Package Characteristics

**CRITICAL DISTINCTIONS:**

| Characteristic | Short-Term Assessment | Other Packages |

## 2. GOVERNING PRINCIPLES

### 2.1 TBRI® Integration

> **📋 DERIVED FROM: TBRI Treatment Model Executive Summary**
>
> Trust-Based Relational Intervention (TBRI®) serves as Refuge House's Evidence-informed Treatment Model, providing the philosophical and practical foundation for all services.
>
> **TBRI® Application to Short-Term Assessment:**
>
> **Connecting Principles:**
> - Build trust quickly through attentive, nurturing care
> - Communicate safety during transitional period
> - Establish felt safety despite short placement duration
>
> **Empowering Principles:**
> - Address physical and environmental needs that support accurate assessment
> - Support sensory processing, nutrition, and sleep regulation
> - Create predictable structure during uncertain transition
>
> **Correcting Principles:**
> - Use proactive and responsive strategies that provide structure
> - Allow authentic behavior observation for assessment purposes
> - Apply trauma-informed responses to behavioral challenges

### 2.2 Assessment-Centered Approach

Our approach recognizes that the assessment period itself is an intervention that begins the child's healing journey. Foster families play a critical role in:

- Observing behavioral patterns
- Documenting responses to interventions
- Providing nurturing care during evaluation
- Supporting accurate assessment through consistent environment
