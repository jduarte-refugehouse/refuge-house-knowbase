# **POLICY SECTIONS**

## **1\. PURPOSE AND COMMITMENT**

The Board of Directors establishes this policy to ensure that youth and young adults ages 14-22 in our care receive comprehensive transition support services that prepare them for successful adulthood. We commit to providing trauma-informed, youth-directed services that honor individual strengths, promote permanency, and build the skills necessary for independent living.

This policy governs the implementation of the Youth Transition Support Services Add-On as defined in the T3C System Blueprint, ensuring full compliance with all regulatory requirements while maintaining our commitment to exceeding minimum standards. We recognize that successful transition to adulthood requires more than meeting basic needs—it demands intentional preparation, meaningful relationships, and the development of both practical skills and personal confidence.

## **2\. GOVERNING PRINCIPLES**

### **2.1 Youth-Centered Approach**

We believe that youth are the experts in their own lives. All transition services shall be delivered with meaningful youth participation in planning and decision-making, with youth fully aware of service expectations and actively directing their transition journey. This approach recognizes that empowerment comes not from doing things for youth, but from doing things with them—teaching self-advocacy skills that will serve them throughout adulthood.

### **2.2 Trauma-Informed Care**

We recognize that youth in foster care have experienced trauma that impacts their development and transition to adulthood. All services shall be delivered through a trauma-informed lens using Trust-Based Relational Intervention® (TBRI®) principles adapted for adolescents. Understanding trauma's impact on brain development, relationship formation, and future orientation allows us to provide support that heals while building independence skills.

### **2.3 Permanency Focus**

We commit to supporting permanent connections for all youth, recognizing that successful transitions are built on stable relationships that extend beyond the foster care system. Every youth needs adults who will celebrate their graduations, provide references for jobs, and answer late-night calls about adult challenges. These connections—whether with family, mentors, or caring professionals—form the foundation of successful adult life.

### **2.4 Equity and Access**

We ensure equitable access to transition services regardless of placement type, disability status, cultural background, or individual circumstances. Each youth's path to adulthood is unique, shaped by their culture, identity, abilities, and dreams. Our services adapt to honor these differences while ensuring all youth receive the support they need to thrive.

### **2.5 Benefit and Resource Expertise**

We maintain staff and foster family expertise in state and federal benefits available to youth in and after foster care, including comprehensive understanding of eligibility requirements, application processes, and timing considerations. This expertise transforms from mere knowledge when staff can translate complex systems into understandable steps, helping youth see benefits not as handouts but as investments in their potential.

## **3\. SERVICE PHILOSOPHY**

Our transition support services are built on the belief that every young person deserves the opportunity to reach their full potential. We provide individualized support that:

- **Honors youth voice and choice in all decisions** \- Recognizing that agency in one's own life is the cornerstone of successful adulthood  
- **Builds on individual strengths and capabilities** \- Every youth brings unique talents that, when recognized and developed, become pathways to success  
- **Addresses barriers to successful transition** \- Understanding that systemic obstacles require intentional support to overcome  
- **Promotes normalcy and age-appropriate experiences** \- Ensuring youth don't miss critical developmental opportunities due to their time in care  
- **Develops sustainable support networks** \- Building connections that will outlast our formal services  
- **Prepares youth for educational and employment success** \- Providing both the skills and confidence needed in competitive environments  
- **Ensures youth understand and actively participate in service planning** \- Making transparency and collaboration the foundation of trust  
- **Adapts to individual age, developmental needs, and primary service package requirements** \- Recognizing that one size never fits all in human development

These principles guide every interaction, ensuring that our services not only meet regulatory requirements but truly prepare youth for meaningful, successful adult lives.

# **PROCEDURE SECTIONS**

## **4\. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLICY AND PROCEDURE**

The following procedures operationalize the principles established in the policy sections by providing specific implementation details. These procedures may be updated by the Executive Director to adapt to regulatory changes or operational improvements without Board approval, provided changes maintain alignment with policy intent. This structure ensures our practices can evolve with emerging best practices and changing youth needs while maintaining fidelity to our core commitments. The procedures translate our aspirations into daily actions, ensuring every youth receives consistent, high-quality support regardless of which staff member or foster family serves them.

## **5\. ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT**

### **Purpose and Overview**

Early identification and enrollment of eligible youth ensures timely access to transition support services. Research consistently shows that youth who receive transition support services beginning at age 14 have significantly better outcomes in education, employment, and housing stability. This section establishes clear procedures for determining eligibility and managing the enrollment process in compliance with T3C Blueprint requirements, ensuring no eligible youth miss the opportunity for these critical services.

### **5.1 Eligibility Determination**

| Who | How | When | Where | Regulatory Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Case Manager | Review youth age and placement status against eligibility criteria | Monthly during case review | Case management system | T3C Blueprint p.148-154 |
| Case Manager | Verify youth is not receiving excluded services (Short-Term Assessment or GRO placement) | At referral | Service authorization records | T3C Blueprint p.148 |
| Supervisor | Approve eligibility determination | Within 2 business days of referral | Supervision log | TAC §749.1301 |

**Eligible Population:**

- Youth ages 14-22 in foster family homes  
- Receiving any T3C Service Package except Short-Term Assessment  
- Not placed in General Residential Operations

The age range 14-22 reflects research showing that transition preparation must begin early while extending support through the critical early adult years. Starting at 14 allows youth to explore interests, build skills gradually, and develop relationships with transition supporters before the pressure of impending adulthood. Continuing through age 22 recognizes that youth from care often need extended support as they navigate early adulthood without the family safety net their peers enjoy.

### **5.2 Enrollment Process**

| Who | How | When | Where | Regulatory Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Case Manager | Submit Add-On Service authorization request to DFPS/SSCC | Within 5 business days of eligibility confirmation | IMPACT or designated system | RCC Contract Term 7 |

| Case Manager | Notify foster family of enhanced service requirements and obtain agreement | Within 2 business days of authorization | Placement agreement | TAC §749.2457 |
| Transition Specialist | Complete initial Casey Life Skills Assessment | Within 30 days of enrollment | CANS or designated system | T3C Blueprint p.149 |

## **6\. STAFFING REQUIREMENTS AND PAL PROGRAM EXPERTISE**

### **Purpose and Overview**

Specialized staffing ensures youth receive expert support throughout their transition journey. The complexity of navigating state and federal benefit systems, combined with the developmental needs of transitioning youth, requires staff who bring both technical knowledge and the ability to build trusting relationships. All staff and Foster Family Home Caregivers providing transition support must possess comprehensive expertise in the PAL Program and state/federal benefits navigation. This expertise is not just preferred but essential—youth depend on accurate, timely information to access benefits that can make the difference between successful independence and homelessness.

### **6.1 Transition Support Specialist Position Requirements**

## **7\. FOSTER FAMILY HOME CREDENTIALING FOR TRANSITION SUPPORT**

### **Purpose and Overview**

Foster Family Homes providing Transition Support Services must demonstrate specific competencies beyond basic T3C credentialing to ensure effective support for transitioning youth. The teenage years bring unique challenges—balancing independence with guidance, supporting identity development, and preparing for adulthood while healing from trauma. Foster families serving transition-age youth need specialized skills to navigate driving lessons, first jobs, college applications, and the emotional complexity of approaching aging out. This credentialing process ensures families are prepared for these unique dynamics.

### **7.1 Assessment and Credentialing Process**

| Who | How | When | Where | Regulatory Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |

| Training Coordinator | Provide annual refresher on PAL updates and benefit changes | Annually | Training records | T3C Blueprint p.149-151 |

## **8\. SERVICE DELIVERY PROCEDURES**

### **Purpose and Overview**

Service delivery must be customized to each youth's age, developmental needs, and primary service package while maintaining core transition support components. A 14-year-old exploring career interests requires a vastly different approach than a 20-year-old navigating apartment applications. Similarly, a youth receiving Mental Health Support Services may need transition planning that carefully balances independence goals with ongoing therapeutic needs. This individualized approach ensures that transition support enhances rather than conflicts with other services the youth receives.

### **8.1 Individual Service Planning**

| Who | How | When | Where | Regulatory Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Transition Specialist | **Integrate transition goals considering:** \- Youth's age and developmental stage \- Primary service package needs \- Individual strengths and challenges \- Cultural and personal preferences | At next scheduled service plan review | Service plan | T3C Blueprint p.149-151 |
| Youth (age 14+) | **Actively participate in service planning with clear understanding of:** \- Available services and supports \- Their role in planning \- Expected outcomes \- How services adapt to their needs | At service plan review | Service plan | TAC §749.1291 |
| Treatment Team | Review and approve integrated transition goals ensuring age-appropriate adaptation | During service plan meeting | Service plan | TAC §749.1309 |

### **8.2 Core Service Components**

| Who | How | When | Where | Regulatory Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |

| Transition Specialist | Facilitate life skills development using PAL curriculum and community programs | Per Casey Life Skills Assessment results | Skills tracking in Radius | T3C Blueprint p.149 |

## **9\. TRANSITION PLANNING PROCESS**

### **Purpose and Overview**

Comprehensive transition planning integrates all required components while remaining youth-directed and developmentally appropriate. The PAL Program provides Texas's framework for preparing youth for adulthood, but true success comes from making these requirements meaningful to each individual youth. When a young person actively participates in planning their future—choosing which PAL events interest them, identifying trusted adults for their Circle of Support, setting personal goals—they develop the self-advocacy skills essential for adult success. This section ensures compliance while honoring youth voice.

### **9.1 Required Transition Activities**

| Case Manager | **Ensure service approach considers:** \- Youth's custom needs \- Age-appropriate strategies \- Developmental readiness \- Primary service package requirements | At service planning | Service plan | T3C Blueprint p.151 |

## **10\. PAL PROGRAM COORDINATION**

### **Purpose and Overview**

The Preparation for Adult Living (PAL) Program provides the framework for transition services in Texas. Since 1986, PAL has helped thousands of Texas youth successfully transition from foster care to independence. Effective coordination ensures youth access all required resources and opportunities—from life skills classes to leadership councils, from college preparation to apartment readiness. The program's strength lies in its comprehensive approach, addressing practical skills while building the confidence and connections youth need for successful adulthood.

### **10.1 PAL Program Requirements**

| Who | How | When | Where | Regulatory Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Transition Specialist | Verify PAL enrollment with DFPS/SSCC | Within 5 days of Add-On enrollment | PAL records | T3C Blueprint p.150 |

| Case Manager | Coordinate with DFPS for EFC eligibility verification | 90 days before 18th birthday | IMPACT | RCC Contract Term 7 |

## **11\. YOUTH EXPECTATIONS AND SERVICE ADAPTABILITY**

### **Purpose and Overview**

Youth must be fully aware of service expectations while services remain flexible and responsive to individual needs. Transparency builds trust—when youth understand why they're attending PAL events or completing benefit applications, they're more likely to engage meaningfully. However, rigid approaches fail to honor the diversity of youth experiences. A youth focused on immediate employment may need different support than one pursuing higher education. Services must flex to meet youth where they are while maintaining core requirements that protect their future options.

### **11.1 Youth Awareness and Engagement**

| Who | How | When | Where | Regulatory Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Transition Specialist | **Ensure youth understands:** \- PAL participation expectations \- Benefit application requirements \- Planning meeting attendance \- Skill development goals \- Available supports and resources | At enrollment and quarterly | Individual meetings | T3C Blueprint p.149 |

| Transition Specialist | **Modify approach for different ages:** \- 14-16: Focus on exploration and skill building \- 17-18: Intensive preparation and planning \- 19-22: Support implementation and independence | Throughout service delivery | Service documentation | T3C Blueprint p.151 |

## **12\. NORMALCY AND YOUTH VOICE**

### **Purpose and Overview**

Normalcy activities are essential for healthy adolescent development. The daily rate includes funding specifically for supporting age-appropriate experiences that build life skills and social connections. Every youth deserves the chance to participate in activities their peers take for granted—driver's education, after-school jobs, sports teams, school dances. These experiences teach lessons no curriculum can capture: teamwork, time management, social skills, and the confidence that comes from belonging. For youth in care, who have often missed these opportunities due to placement changes or trauma, normalcy activities provide crucial developmental experiences while building the natural support networks essential for successful adulthood.

### **12.1 Normalcy Support Activities**

| Who | How | When | Where | Regulatory Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Transition Specialist | Assess youth interests and normalcy needs | At enrollment and quarterly | Normalcy plan | TAC §749.1291 |
| Foster Parent | Apply reasonable and prudent parent standard for activity approval | As opportunities arise | Placement records | TAC §749.1293 |
| Transition Specialist | **Support driver's license/state ID acquisition including:** \- Driver's education enrollment \- Practice driving coordination \- Insurance planning \- DMV appointment support | Age-appropriate timing | Transportation plan | T3C Blueprint p.151 |
| Finance Dept | Track normalcy expenses funded through Add-On rate | Monthly | Financial records | T3C Blueprint p.148 |

**Funded Normalcy Activities Include:**

- **Employment and job training** \- From first job applications to career exploration, work experience teaches invaluable life lessons  
- **Driver's education and licensing** \- In many Texas communities, driving isn't luxury but necessity for employment and education  
- **Extracurricular activities participation as directed by youth** \- Whether sports, arts, or clubs, these activities build identity and belonging  
- **Social and recreational opportunities** \- Friendships formed through shared interests often become lifelong support networks  
- **Technology access (phone, internet)** \- Digital literacy and connectivity are non-negotiable requirements for modern adulthood  
- **Faith community participation** \- For youth who choose it, spiritual communities provide both support and sense of purpose

These activities aren't extras—they're essential investments in youth development, funded through the enhanced daily rate because Texas recognizes their critical importance.

### **12.2 Youth Leadership Development**

| Who | How | When | Where | Regulatory Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Transition Specialist | **Support Youth Leadership Council participation for interested youth** | Per regional schedule | YLC records | T3C Blueprint p.150 |
| Youth | Participate in program improvement discussions | Monthly or as desired | Meeting notes | TAC §749.1291 |
| Program Director | Incorporate youth feedback into program development | Quarterly | CQI documentation | TAC §749.665 |

## **13\. AFTERCARE SERVICES**

### **Purpose and Overview**

Aftercare services ensure continuity of support as youth transition from care. These services are funded through the daily Add-On rate and must continue for a minimum of 6 months post-discharge. The months immediately following discharge often determine long-term success—this is when apartment leases are tested, first jobs become challenging, and the safety net of foster care feels frighteningly absent. Research shows that youth who maintain connection with supportive adults during this period are far more likely to achieve stability. Our aftercare services provide this bridge, offering both practical support and the reassurance that someone still cares about their success.

### **13.1 Aftercare Planning**

| Who | How | When | Where | Regulatory Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Transition Specialist | Develop written aftercare plan with youth | **6 months before** anticipated discharge | Aftercare plan | T3C Blueprint p.152 |
| Youth | Identify aftercare support needs and preferences | During planning process | Aftercare plan | TAC §749.503 |
| DFPS/SSCC PAL Worker | Collaborate on aftercare resources | During transition planning | Joint staffing notes | RCC Contract Term 7 |

### **13.2 Aftercare Service Delivery**

| Who | How | When | Where | Regulatory Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Transition Specialist | Provide contact via youth's preferred method (phone, text, email, or in-person) | **Month 1:** Weekly \*\*Month 2-3:\*\* Bi-weekly \*\*Month 4-6:\*\* Twice monthly | Contact log in Radius | T3C Blueprint p.152 |

| Transition Specialist | **Submit documentation to SSCC/DFPS caseworker** | **End of each month** during 6-month aftercare period | Electronic submission | T3C Blueprint p.152 |

## **14\. DOCUMENTATION AND OUTCOMES**

### **Purpose and Overview**

Comprehensive documentation ensures service quality, regulatory compliance, and outcome tracking while supporting continuous improvement. Beyond meeting regulatory requirements, thoughtful documentation tells the story of each youth's journey—capturing not just compliance checkboxes but the moments of breakthrough, the skills mastered, and the confidence gained. This documentation serves multiple purposes: demonstrating our effectiveness to funders, identifying successful strategies to replicate, and most importantly, ensuring that the next worker supporting a youth understands their full story and can build upon established progress rather than starting over.

## **15\. QUALITY ASSURANCE**

### **Purpose and Overview**

Continuous quality improvement ensures services remain effective and responsive to youth needs while maintaining compliance with all requirements. Quality assurance in transition services means more than checking boxes—it means regularly asking whether our services truly prepare youth for the futures they envision. Are youth gaining real skills or just attending required meetings? Do our foster families feel equipped to support transition-age youth? Are we adapting as benefit programs change and new resources emerge? This ongoing evaluation, driven by both data and youth feedback, ensures our services evolve to meet the changing needs of each generation of youth we serve.

### **15.1 Quality Monitoring**
