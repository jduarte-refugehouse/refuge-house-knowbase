# POLICY SECTIONS

## 1. PURPOSE AND SERVICE PACKAGE DESCRIPTION

### 1.1 Service Package Definition

Mental & Behavioral Health Support Services provides trauma-informed foster care for children, youth, and young adults with mental health diagnoses who require specialized therapeutic support beyond Basic Foster Family Home services.

### 1.2 Target Population

Children, youth, and young adults who:

- Have a diagnosed mental health condition requiring specialized support
- Need therapeutic services coordinated through STAR Health
- Can be safely served in a family setting with appropriate services
- May have co-occurring needs (trauma history, behavioral challenges)

### 1.3 Dual Credentialing Requirement

In addition to maintaining the Mental & Behavioral Health Support Services Package credential, the Child Placing Agency and Foster Family Home Caregivers must be Credentialed to provide the T3C Basic Foster Family Home Support Service Package. This allows for step-down within the same foster family home when the child no longer requires Mental & Behavioral Health services.

---

## 2. GOVERNING PRINCIPLES

### 2.1 TBRI® Integration

> **📋 DERIVED FROM: TBRI Treatment Model Executive Summary**
>
> Refuge House's Evidence-informed Treatment Model applies Trust-Based Relational Intervention (TBRI®) principles across all Service Packages. For Mental & Behavioral Health Support Services, TBRI principles are enhanced with clinical mental health interventions:
>
> **Connecting Principles:** Building trust and connection that supports mental health recovery, recognizing that healthy relationships are foundational to healing.
>
> **Empowering Principles:** Addressing physical regulation needs that impact mental health, including nutrition, sleep, and sensory processing.
>
> **Correcting Principles:** Trauma-informed response philosophy recognizing that behaviors often stem from unmet needs and past experiences.
