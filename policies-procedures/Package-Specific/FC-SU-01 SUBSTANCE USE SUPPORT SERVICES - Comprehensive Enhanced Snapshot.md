## 2. GOVERNING PRINCIPLES

### 2.1 TBRI® Integration

> **📋 DERIVED FROM: TBRI Treatment Model Executive Summary**
>
> Refuge House's Evidence-informed Treatment Model applies Trust-Based Relational Intervention (TBRI®) principles across all Service Packages. For Substance Use Support Services, TBRI principles are enhanced with recovery-oriented approach:
>
> **Connecting Principles:** Building trust and connection that supports recovery, recognizing that healthy relationships are protective factors against substance use.
>
> **Empowering Principles:** Addressing physical regulation needs complicated by substance use, including nutrition, sleep, and sensory processing affected by substance use or withdrawal.
>
> **Correcting Principles:** Non-punitive response philosophy recognizing that relapse is part of recovery process.

### 2.2 Non-Punitive Response Philosophy

**CRITICAL:** All substance-related behaviors are addressed as clinical matters requiring treatment adjustment, NOT as behavioral infractions requiring punishment.
