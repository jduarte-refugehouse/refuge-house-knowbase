#### Youth-Informed Service Planning

Service Plans must be informed by the child, youth, or young adult (when age-appropriate) and developed in collaboration with the Service Planning team. Each Service Plan includes:

- **Customized goals** developed with meaningful youth input that reflect their voice, perspective, and priorities
- **Specific services and supports** tailored to achieve each goal
- **Documentation of youth participation** in the goal-setting and planning process
- **Cultural considerations** that honor the youth's identity and values

The Service Planning team incorporates input from the child/youth, Case Manager, Treatment Director, Licensed Therapist, Foster Parents, SSCC/DFPS caseworker, biological family/support persons (when appropriate), educational representatives, and medical providers (as applicable).

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Substance Use Support Services p.59 (October 2025) - Service Plan must be informed by child/youth and include customized goals and planned services to achieve those goals.

#### Service Plan Review - Progress Documentation

Service Plan reviews must include documentation demonstrating the progress made toward achieving **each goal** identified in the Service Plan. Progress documentation is:

- **Goal-specific** - addressing each stated goal individually, not general observations
- **Measurable** - using objective indicators where possible (frequency, duration, intensity)
- **Descriptive** - providing specific examples and observations that illustrate progress or challenges
- **Action-oriented** - identifying next steps, adjustments, and continued supports needed

For each goal in the Service Plan, the review documents:
- Current status of goal achievement (no progress, minimal progress, moderate progress, significant progress, goal achieved)
- Specific examples demonstrating current functioning related to the goal
- Effective interventions and supports that have promoted progress
- Barriers to progress and challenges encountered
- Adjustments needed to services, supports, or the goal itself

**Review Frequency:** Service Plan reviews occur every 90 days minimum for Substance Use Support Services, conducted in conjunction with Continued Stay Review.

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Substance Use Support Services p.59 (October 2025) - Service Plan reviews must include documentation to show the progress made toward achieving each goal.

**Cross-Reference:** FC3-01.1 Individual Service Planning Procedure Section 3 (Service Plan Reviews)

#### CANS 3.0 Assessment Requirements

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Substance Use Support Services p.60 (October 2025)

Children over the age of 3, youth, and young adults must receive CANS 3.0 Assessments according to the following schedule:

**Initial Assessment:**
- Children ages 3-5: Within 21 days of placement
- Children ages 6 and older: Within 30 days of placement

**Ongoing Assessments:**
- **Every 90 days** thereafter for the duration of placement

**Children Age 3 and Under:**
- CANS 3.0 not required but may be completed if clinically indicated

**Assessment Administration:**
- Conducted by licensed clinical staff certified in CANS 3.0 administration (LMSW, LPC, LCSW, LPC-S, LMFT)
- Treatment Director or designee coordinates completion
- Case Manager ensures scheduling and follow-through

**Integration with Service Planning:**

Results of the most recent CANS 3.0 Assessment must be used to inform the customized Service Plan, including adjustments to the type of, frequency, and duration of services. This integration occurs at multiple points:

**At Initial Service Plan Development (30 days):**
- CANS 3.0 domains with high needs (ratings of 2-3) drive goal prioritization
- Service type selection matches CANS-identified needs (individual vs. family therapy, specialized substance use treatment)
- Service frequency determined by CANS severity ratings and needs
- Strengths identified in CANS leveraged in treatment approach

**At Each 90-Day Service Plan Review:**
- Compare current CANS 3.0 to previous assessment(s)
- Analyze changes in CANS domains to evaluate service effectiveness
- Adjust service type based on changing needs (e.g., add family therapy if caregiver support domain declines)
- Modify service frequency based on progress or regression in key domains
- Adjust service duration/intensity based on overall CANS trajectory

**Specific CANS-Driven Adjustments:**
- **Increased therapy frequency:** When CANS shows worsening in behavioral/emotional domains
- **Addition of family therapy:** When CANS indicates declining caregiver resources or family functioning
- **Intensification of substance use treatment:** When CANS reveals increased substance use severity
- **Step-down planning:** When CANS demonstrates sustained improvement across multiple domains
- **Service array expansion:** When CANS identifies new needs in previously stable domains

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Service Plan explicitly references CANS 3.0 findings
- Service adjustments directly linked to CANS domain changes
- Rationale for service type, frequency, and duration documented with CANS support
- Progress toward goals measured against CANS improvement

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Substance Use Support Services p.60 (October 2025) - Results of the CANS 3.0 Assessment must be used to inform the customized Service Plan, including adjustments to the type of, frequency, and duration of services.

**Cross-Reference:** FC3-01.1 Individual Service Planning Procedure Section 1.7 (CANS 3.0 Implementation)

### 5.5 Service Plan Reviews and Continued Stay Requirements

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Substance Use Support Services p.60 (October 2025)

Service Plan reviews must occur at minimum every 90 days and include written confirmation of the child's continued need for Substance Use Support Services.

#### 90-Day Service Plan Review Cycle

**Regulatory Requirement:** Unlike Basic Foster Family Home (6-month reviews), Substance Use Support Services requires more frequent monitoring through 90-day Service Plan reviews that coincide with Continued Stay evaluations.

**Review Components:**

| Component | Description | Documentation Location |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|
| Progress Toward Goals | Documentation of progress on each Service Plan goal per Element 2 | Service Plan Review section |
| CANS 3.0 Integration | Analysis of CANS changes since last assessment per Element 4 | Service Plan Review section |
| Youth Voice | Documentation of youth participation per Element 1 | Service Plan Review section |
| Therapy Effectiveness | Evaluation of therapy types and adjustments per Element 5 | Service Plan Review section |
| **Continued Stay Evaluation** | **Written confirmation of continued need for Substance Use services** | **T3C Supplement Form** |

#### Continued Stay Guidelines

Continued Stay Reviews evaluate whether the child continues to meet criteria for Substance Use Support Services and whether services remain appropriate to support recovery and permanency goals.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. **Primary Admission Reason:**
   - Does the child continue to require substance use intervention services?
   - Has the substance use disorder been addressed to the point where step-down is appropriate?
   - Are there new or ongoing substance use concerns requiring continued specialized support?

2. **CANS 3.0 Alignment:**
   - How have substance use-related CANS domains changed since admission/last review?
   - Do current CANS results support continued need for specialized substance use services?
   - Are CANS improvements sufficient to warrant transition to lower service level?

3. **Service Effectiveness:**
   - Are current services supporting recovery progress toward permanency goals?
   - Have services been adjusted based on youth response and CANS data?
   - Is the service array appropriate for current recovery stage?

4. **Recovery Stability:**
   - What is the youth's current recovery status (active recovery, relapse, etc.)?
   - Are protective factors strengthening (family support, prosocial peers, coping skills)?
   - What risk factors remain that require ongoing specialized services?

**Decision Framework:**

| Recovery Status | CANS Trajectory | Continued Stay Decision |
|----------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Sustained recovery progress | Multiple domains improving | Consider step-down to MH/BH or Basic |
| Early recovery with stability | Some improvement, needs remain | Continue Substance Use services |
| Active use or recent relapse | Stable or worsening domains | Continue Substance Use services; intensify |
| Minimal engagement | No improvement or worsening | Clinical staffing; consider higher level of care |
