## 4. LENGTH OF SERVICE PARAMETERS

### 4.1 Length of Service

**Cross-Reference:** Length of service follows **FC-T3C-01 T3C Basic Foster Family Home Support Services Policy** guidelines, customized based on individual recovery needs and treatment progress.

### 4.2 Anticipated Length of Service

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Substance Use Support Services p.60 (October 2025)

Refuge House has established anticipated length of service for children served under Substance Use Support Services, recognizing that recovery timelines vary based on individual needs and progress.

#### Expected Length of Service Guidelines

**Standard Recovery-Focused Placement:**
- **Expected Duration:** 6-12 months for most children
- **Rationale:** Sufficient time to achieve sustained recovery, develop coping skills, and build relapse prevention capacity

**Factors Influencing Length of Service:**

| Factor | Shorter Stay (6-9 months) | Longer Stay (9-12 months) |
|--------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Substance Use Severity** | Single substance, recent onset | Polysubstance use, long history |
| **Co-Occurring Needs** | Minimal mental health issues | Complex trauma, severe mental health needs |
| **Recovery Progress** | Rapid engagement, consistent abstinence | Relapse patterns, inconsistent engagement |
| **Support System** | Strong family/community supports | Limited supports, placement in support network |
| **Permanency Planning** | Clear permanency plan with timeline | Uncertain permanency, barriers to discharge |
| **Treatment Compliance** | Consistent therapy attendance | Missed appointments, resistance to treatment |

#### CANS-Based Length of Service Planning

**Using CANS 3.0 to Project Duration:**

| CANS Pattern | Anticipated Duration | Planning Considerations |
|--------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Substance Use domain improving (3→2→1)** | 6-9 months | Plan for step-down to Basic or MH/BH package |
| **Multiple domains at 2-3 besides substance use** | 9-12 months | Address co-occurring needs comprehensively |
| **Substance Use stable at 0-1, other domains improving** | 6 months | Consider early step-down with aftercare support |
| **Persistent rating of 3 in Substance Use** | 12+ months or step-up to TFFC | May need more intensive intervention |

#### Recovery Stage Considerations

**Early Recovery (Months 1-3):**
- Assessment and engagement phase
- Intensive weekly therapy
- Building coping skills foundation
- Expected to remain in Substance Use package

**Middle Recovery (Months 4-8):**
- Active recovery work
- Skill application and relapse prevention
- Evaluate progress toward step-down
- May continue or plan transition

**Sustained Recovery (Months 9-12):**
- Recovery consolidation
- Transition planning active
- Step-down to lower service level typically appropriate
- Aftercare planning intensifies

#### Step-Down Planning Timeline

**6-Month Review - Step-Down Assessment:**
- Evaluate sustained recovery (typically 90+ days abstinence)
- Review CANS improvements
- Assess support system strength
- Consider appropriateness of step-down to:
  * Mental & Behavioral Health package (if ongoing therapy needed)
  * Basic Foster Family Home (if stable with minimal clinical needs)

**9-Month Review - Transition Decision:**
- If still in Substance Use package at 9 months, establish clear transition timeline
- Identify barriers to step-down
- Intensify permanency planning
- Set specific goals for discharge

**12-Month Review - Extension Justification:**
- If placement extends beyond 12 months, document specific justification
- Identify what additional time will accomplish
- Set firm discharge timeline (typically 3-6 months)

#### Documentation of Anticipated Length of Service

**At Initial Service Plan (30 days):**

Case Manager documents:
- Projected length of service based on initial assessment: _____ months
- Factors supporting this projection:
  * Severity of substance use
  * Co-occurring needs
  * Support system strength
  * Permanency plan timeline
- Anticipated step-down date: ___________
- Service milestones expected at 3, 6, 9 months

**At Each 90-Day Review:**

Treatment Director evaluates:
- Is child progressing as anticipated?
- Should projected length of service be adjusted?
- What factors are accelerating or delaying progress?
- Is step-down timeline still realistic?
- Updated anticipated discharge date: ___________

#### Quality Assurance for Length of Service

| Who | How | When |
|-----|-----|------|
| Treatment Director | Review all Substance Use placements monthly:<br>- Identify placements approaching 6, 9, 12 months<br>- Evaluate progress toward discharge<br>- Identify barriers to step-down<br>- Recommend service adjustments or discharge planning | Monthly |
| Program Director | Analyze aggregate length of service data:<br>- Average length of stay<br>- Percentage achieving step-down by 12 months<br>- Factors associated with longer stays<br>- Comparison to anticipated timelines | Quarterly |

**Compliance Targets:**
- 80% of placements achieve step-down within anticipated timeline (±3 months)
- 90% of placements discharge or step-down within 15 months
- 100% of placements exceeding 12 months have documented justification

**NOTE:** There is no maximum length of service specified for Substance Use Support Services in the T3C Blueprint. However, time-limited intervention philosophy emphasizes working toward step-down rather than indefinite placement.

#### Youth-Informed Service Planning

Service Plans must be informed by the child, youth, or young adult (when age-appropriate) and developed in collaboration with the Service Planning team. Each Service Plan includes:

- **Customized goals** developed with meaningful youth input that reflect their voice, perspective, and priorities
- **Specific services and supports** tailored to achieve each goal
- **Documentation of youth participation** in the goal-setting and planning process
- **Cultural considerations** that honor the youth's identity and values

The Service Planning team incorporates input from the child/youth, Case Manager, Treatment Director, Licensed Therapist, Foster Parents, SSCC/DFPS caseworker, biological family/support persons (when appropriate), educational representatives, and medical providers (as applicable).

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Substance Use Support Services p.59 (October 2025) - Service Plan must be informed by child/youth and include customized goals and planned services to achieve those goals.

#### Service Plan Review - Progress Documentation

Service Plan reviews must include documentation demonstrating the progress made toward achieving **each goal** identified in the Service Plan. Progress documentation is:

- **Goal-specific** - addressing each stated goal individually, not general observations
- **Measurable** - using objective indicators where possible (frequency, duration, intensity)
- **Descriptive** - providing specific examples and observations that illustrate progress or challenges
- **Action-oriented** - identifying next steps, adjustments, and continued supports needed

For each goal in the Service Plan, the review documents:
- Current status of goal achievement (no progress, minimal progress, moderate progress, significant progress, goal achieved)
- Specific examples demonstrating current functioning related to the goal
- Effective interventions and supports that have promoted progress
- Barriers to progress and challenges encountered
- Adjustments needed to services, supports, or the goal itself

**Review Frequency:** Service Plan reviews occur every 90 days minimum for Substance Use Support Services, conducted in conjunction with Continued Stay Review.

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Substance Use Support Services p.59 (October 2025) - Service Plan reviews must include documentation to show the progress made toward achieving each goal.

**Cross-Reference:** FC3-01.1 Individual Service Planning Procedure Section 3 (Service Plan Reviews)

#### CANS 3.0 Assessment Requirements

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Substance Use Support Services p.60 (October 2025)

Children over the age of 3, youth, and young adults must receive CANS 3.0 Assessments according to the following schedule:

**Initial Assessment:**
- Children ages 3-5: Within 21 days of placement
- Children ages 6 and older: Within 30 days of placement

**Ongoing Assessments:**
- **Every 90 days** thereafter for the duration of placement

**Children Age 3 and Under:**
- CANS 3.0 not required but may be completed if clinically indicated

**Assessment Administration:**
- Conducted by licensed clinical staff certified in CANS 3.0 administration (LMSW, LPC, LCSW, LPC-S, LMFT)
- Treatment Director or designee coordinates completion
- Case Manager ensures scheduling and follow-through

**Integration with Service Planning:**

Results of the most recent CANS 3.0 Assessment must be used to inform the customized Service Plan, including adjustments to the type of, frequency, and duration of services. This integration occurs at multiple points:

**At Initial Service Plan Development (30 days):**
- CANS 3.0 domains with high needs (ratings of 2-3) drive goal prioritization
- Service type selection matches CANS-identified needs (individual vs. family therapy, specialized substance use treatment)
- Service frequency determined by CANS severity ratings and needs
- Strengths identified in CANS leveraged in treatment approach

**At Each 90-Day Service Plan Review:**
- Compare current CANS 3.0 to previous assessment(s)
- Analyze changes in CANS domains to evaluate service effectiveness
- Adjust service type based on changing needs (e.g., add family therapy if caregiver support domain declines)
- Modify service frequency based on progress or regression in key domains
- Adjust service duration/intensity based on overall CANS trajectory

**Specific CANS-Driven Adjustments:**
- **Increased therapy frequency:** When CANS shows worsening in behavioral/emotional domains
- **Addition of family therapy:** When CANS indicates declining caregiver resources or family functioning
- **Intensification of substance use treatment:** When CANS reveals increased substance use severity
- **Step-down planning:** When CANS demonstrates sustained improvement across multiple domains
- **Service array expansion:** When CANS identifies new needs in previously stable domains

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Service Plan explicitly references CANS 3.0 findings
- Service adjustments directly linked to CANS domain changes
- Rationale for service type, frequency, and duration documented with CANS support
- Progress toward goals measured against CANS improvement

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Substance Use Support Services p.60 (October 2025) - Results of the CANS 3.0 Assessment must be used to inform the customized Service Plan, including adjustments to the type of, frequency, and duration of services.

**Cross-Reference:** FC3-01.1 Individual Service Planning Procedure Section 1.7 (CANS 3.0 Implementation)

### 5.5 Service Plan Reviews and Continued Stay Requirements

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** Substance Use Support Services p.60 (October 2025)

Service Plan reviews must occur at minimum every 90 days and include written confirmation of the child's continued need for Substance Use Support Services.

#### 90-Day Service Plan Review Cycle

**Regulatory Requirement:** Unlike Basic Foster Family Home (6-month reviews), Substance Use Support Services requires more frequent monitoring through 90-day Service Plan reviews that coincide with Continued Stay evaluations.

**Review Components:**

| Component | Description | Documentation Location |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|
| Progress Toward Goals | Documentation of progress on each Service Plan goal per Element 2 | Service Plan Review section |
| CANS 3.0 Integration | Analysis of CANS changes since last assessment per Element 4 | Service Plan Review section |
| Youth Voice | Documentation of youth participation per Element 1 | Service Plan Review section |
| Therapy Effectiveness | Evaluation of therapy types and adjustments per Element 5 | Service Plan Review section |
| **Continued Stay Evaluation** | **Written confirmation of continued need for Substance Use services** | **T3C Supplement Form** |

#### Continued Stay Guidelines

Continued Stay Reviews evaluate whether the child continues to meet criteria for Substance Use Support Services and whether services remain appropriate to support recovery and permanency goals.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. **Primary Admission Reason:**
   - Does the child continue to require substance use intervention services?
   - Has the substance use disorder been addressed to the point where step-down is appropriate?
   - Are there new or ongoing substance use concerns requiring continued specialized support?

2. **CANS 3.0 Alignment:**
   - How have substance use-related CANS domains changed since admission/last review?
   - Do current CANS results support continued need for specialized substance use services?
   - Are CANS improvements sufficient to warrant transition to lower service level?

3. **Service Effectiveness:**
   - Are current services supporting recovery progress toward permanency goals?
   - Have services been adjusted based on youth response and CANS data?
   - Is the service array appropriate for current recovery stage?

4. **Recovery Stability:**
   - What is the youth's current recovery status (active recovery, relapse, etc.)?
   - Are protective factors strengthening (family support, prosocial peers, coping skills)?
   - What risk factors remain that require ongoing specialized services?

**Decision Framework:**
