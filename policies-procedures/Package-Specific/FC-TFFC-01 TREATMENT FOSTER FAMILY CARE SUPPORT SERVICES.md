- FC-16 Staff and Caregiver Training Policy Section 4.6 (TFFC Foster Parent Training)

#### Youth-Informed Service Planning

Service Plans must be informed by the child, youth, or young adult (when age-appropriate) and developed in collaboration with the Service Planning team. Each Service Plan includes:

- **Customized goals** developed with meaningful youth input that reflect their voice, perspective, and priorities
- **Specific services and supports** tailored to achieve each goal
- **Documentation of youth participation** in the goal-setting and planning process
- **Cultural considerations** that honor the youth's identity and values

The Service Planning team incorporates input from the child/youth, Case Manager, Treatment Director, Licensed Therapist, Foster Parents, SSCC/DFPS caseworker, biological family/support persons (when appropriate), educational representatives, and medical providers (as applicable).

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** TFFC Support Services p.138 (October 2025) - Service Plan must be informed by child/youth and include customized goals and planned services to achieve those goals.

#### Service Plan Review - Progress Documentation

Service Plan reviews must include documentation demonstrating the progress made toward achieving **each goal** identified in the Service Plan. Progress documentation is:

- **Goal-specific** - addressing each stated goal individually, not general observations
- **Measurable** - using objective indicators where possible (frequency, duration, intensity)
- **Descriptive** - providing specific examples and observations that illustrate progress or challenges
- **Action-oriented** - identifying next steps, adjustments, and continued supports needed

For each goal in the Service Plan, the review documents:
- Current status of goal achievement (no progress, minimal progress, moderate progress, significant progress, goal achieved)
- Specific examples demonstrating current functioning related to the goal
- Effective interventions and supports that have promoted progress
- Barriers to progress and challenges encountered
- Adjustments needed to services, supports, or the goal itself

**Review Frequency:** Service Plan reviews occur **every 60 days** for TFFC Support Services, reflecting the intensive clinical intervention and time-limited nature of this package.

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** TFFC Support Services p.138 (October 2025) - Service Plan reviews must include documentation to show the progress made toward achieving each goal.

**Cross-Reference:** FC3-01.1 Individual Service Planning Procedure Section 3 (Service Plan Reviews)

#### CANS 3.0 Assessment Requirements

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** TFFC Support Services p.139 (October 2025)

Children over the age of 3, youth, and young adults must receive CANS 3.0 Assessments according to the following schedule:

**Initial Assessment:**
- Children ages 3-5: Within 21 days of placement
- Children ages 6 and older: Within 30 days of placement

**Ongoing Assessments:**
- **Every 90 days** thereafter for the duration of placement

**Children Age 3 and Under:**
- CANS 3.0 not required but may be completed if clinically indicated

**TFFC-Specific Considerations:**
- Given intensive clinical intervention and 60-day Service Plan reviews, CANS 3.0 provides critical data for treatment adjustments
- Results analyzed in conjunction with 60-day reviews to assess progress and continued need for TFFC-level services
- Changes in CANS 3.0 domains inform step-down planning and transition readiness

**Assessment Administration:**
- Conducted by licensed clinical staff certified in CANS 3.0 administration (LMSW, LPC, LCSW, LPC-S, LMFT)
- Treatment Director or designee coordinates completion
- Case Manager ensures scheduling and follow-through

**Integration with Intensive Services:**

Results of the most recent CANS 3.0 Assessment must be used to inform the customized Service Plan, including adjustments to the type of, frequency, and duration of intensive therapeutic services. Given the high-acuity nature of TFFC, CANS integration is critical for treatment effectiveness:

**At Initial Service Plan Development (30 days):**
- CANS 3.0 domains with actionable needs (ratings of 2-3) drive intensive goal development
- Therapy type selection matches CANS-identified needs (individual, family, group, specialized modalities)
- Therapy frequency determined by CANS severity and complexity (weekly minimum, may increase to multiple sessions weekly)
- Crisis risk domains inform safety planning and on-call therapist protocols

**At Each 60-Day Service Plan Review:**
- Compare current CANS 3.0 to previous assessment(s) (baseline and 90-day if available)
- Analyze CANS changes to evaluate intensive intervention effectiveness
- Adjust therapy type based on domain-specific progress or challenges
- Modify therapy frequency based on clinical response and CANS trajectory
- Assess step-down readiness using CANS improvement across multiple domains

**TFFC-Specific CANS-Driven Adjustments:**
- **Increased therapy frequency:** When CANS shows minimal improvement or regression despite weekly therapy
- **Addition of specialized modalities:** When CANS reveals specific needs (e.g., DBT for emotion regulation, trauma-focused for PTSD domains)
- **Family therapy intensification:** When CANS indicates caregiver stress or family dysfunction hindering progress
- **Step-down initiation:** When CANS demonstrates sustained improvement allowing transition to MH/BH package
- **Continued TFFC justification:** CANS data supports continued need for intensive services in Continued Stay reviews

**Step-Down Planning:**
- CANS improvement across behavioral/emotional domains triggers step-down assessment
- Target: Move from actionable (2-3) to watchful/strengths (0-1) in key domains
- Sustained CANS improvement over two consecutive assessments indicates readiness
- Step-down plan includes projected CANS targets for successful transition

**Regression in domains triggers immediate clinical review and service adjustment:**
- Emergency clinical staffing when CANS shows significant worsening
- Immediate adjustment to therapy frequency or modality
- Enhanced safety planning if risk domains deteriorate
- Caregiver support intensification if placement stability threatened

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Service Plan explicitly documents CANS findings and their clinical implications
- Therapy frequency justified with reference to specific CANS domains
- Service adjustments directly linked to CANS domain changes with clinical rationale
- Continued Stay reviews include CANS-based justification for TFFC-level intensity
- Step-down planning references CANS targets and current progress

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** TFFC Support Services p.139 (October 2025) - Results of the CANS 3.0 Assessment must be used to inform the customized Service Plan, including adjustments to the type of, frequency, and duration of services.

**Cross-Reference:** FC3-01.1 Individual Service Planning Procedure Section 1.7 (CANS 3.0 Implementation)

### 5.3 Service Plan Reviews and Continued Stay Requirements

**T3C Blueprint Reference:** TFFC Support Services p.139 (October 2025)

TFFC requires the most rigorous review process of any T3C Service Package, with Service Plan reviews every 60 days and enhanced Continued Stay evaluation requiring **dual clinical signatures**.

#### 60-Day Service Plan Review Cycle

**Accelerated Timeline:** TFFC reviews occur every 60 days (compared to 90 days for other specialized packages) due to intensive intervention and time-limited treatment model.

**Review Components:**

| Component | Description | TFFC-Specific Requirements |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------------|
| Progress Toward Goals | Intensive therapeutic goals progress | Must show measurable clinical progress |
| CANS 3.0 Integration | Compare to baseline and previous assessments | Critical for step-down evaluation |
| Therapy Effectiveness | Multiple weekly sessions evaluated | Justify continued intensive frequency |
| Crisis Events | Any safety incidents or hospitalizations | Document response and service adjustments |
| **Continued Stay Evaluation** | **Dual signature requirement** | **Treatment Director AND Program Director** |

#### Enhanced Continued Stay Guidelines for TFFC

TFFC Continued Stay Reviews require heightened clinical scrutiny due to intensive service level and higher daily rate.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. **Initial Admission Criteria Still Met:**
   - Does child continue to present with DSM-5 emotional/conduct/behavioral disorder?
   - Are any of the high-acuity factors still present:
     * Major self-injurious actions or ongoing suicide risk?
     * Significant risk of harm to others with frequent/unpredictable aggression?
     * Severe substance use disorder with significant impairment?

2. **Continued Need for Intensive Services:**
   - Have lower service levels been attempted and proven insufficient?
   - Does CANS 3.0 show domains at rating 2-3 requiring intensive intervention?
   - Would step-down to Mental & Behavioral Health result in placement disruption or safety concerns?

3. **CANS 3.0 Trajectory Analysis:**
   - Are CANS domains improving with intensive services?
   - If no improvement, what service adjustments are planned?
   - If improving, when is step-down appropriate?
   - What CANS thresholds indicate readiness for transition?

4. **Treatment Progress:**
   - Is youth responding to intensive therapeutic interventions?
   - Are therapy sessions productive and showing benefit?
   - Is family/caregiver engagement supporting treatment?
   - What measurable improvements justify continued intensive services?

5. **Time-Limited Nature:**
   - TFFC is designed as time-limited, concentrated intervention
   - What is projected timeline for step-down?
   - If exceeding typical duration (6-12 months), what is justification?
   - Is treatment plan moving toward lower service level?

**Decision Framework:**

| CANS Trajectory | Treatment Response | Safety Status | Continued Stay Decision |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------|------------------------|
| Improving across multiple domains | Good engagement, measurable progress | Stable, no recent crises | Begin step-down planning; target 30-60 days |
| Some improvement, high-need domains remain | Moderate engagement, uneven progress | Generally stable with occasional incidents | Continue TFFC; intensive monitoring |
| Minimal/no improvement | Poor engagement or limited progress | Ongoing safety concerns | Continue TFFC; consider service adjustments |
| Worsening domains | Deterioration despite services | Frequent crises/hospitalizations | Clinical staffing; consider higher level of care |

#### Dual Signature Requirement

**CRITICAL TFFC-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT:** Continued Stay decisions for TFFC require signatures from BOTH Treatment Director AND Program Director.

**Rationale for Dual Review:**
- Highest service intensity requires enhanced oversight
- Clinical and operational leadership both accountable
