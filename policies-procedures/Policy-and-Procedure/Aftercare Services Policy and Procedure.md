| **REVISION DATE** | 12.27.2024.1; 12.09.2025.1 |

## PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW

This procedure operationalizes the Aftercare Services Policy (FC-AF-01) by providing detailed implementation steps for planning and delivering aftercare services to children, youth, and young adults transitioning from foster care placement. The procedure ensures compliance with T3C Blueprint requirements and maintains continuity of care during critical transition periods, with enhanced requirements for specialized service packages.

The importance of aftercare services cannot be overstated. Research consistently shows that the first six months following discharge from care represent a critical period where youth are most vulnerable to placement disruption, re-entry into care, or negative life outcomes. By providing structured support during this transition, we significantly increase the likelihood of successful permanency and positive youth development.

## RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLICY AND PROCEDURE

The Aftercare Services Policy establishes the agency's commitment to supporting successful transitions through comprehensive aftercare planning and service delivery. This procedure document provides the specific operational steps, timelines, responsibilities, and documentation requirements necessary to implement that policy commitment effectively across all service packages. While the policy defines what we will do and why, this procedure details who will do it, when, where, and how.
