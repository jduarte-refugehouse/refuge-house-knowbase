## DEFINITIONS

**Crisis**: A situation in which a child's behavior endangers themselves or others, or when there is possible harm to significant property, requiring immediate intervention beyond typical de-escalation strategies.

**Crisis Management Staff**: Personnel trained in crisis intervention and de-escalation techniques who are available 24/7 to respond to behavioral emergencies, as required per T3C Service Package ratios (1:25 children).

**Emergency Behavior Intervention**: Techniques authorized under TAC §749.901, including personal restraint used only when a child's behavior endangers themselves or others or when there is possible harm to significant property.

**Personal Restraint**: Any contact with a caregiver's body applied to restrict the movement of a child's body, as defined by TAC §749.339(6).

**Personal Safety Plan**: A written plan required per TAC §749.1309 for children exhibiting high-risk behaviors that create immediate safety risks.

**Feelings Thermometer**: A five-level visual tool used to help children identify and communicate their emotional state (Level 1: Calm & Ready; Level 2: A Little Unsure; Level 3: Getting Big; Level 4: Very Upset; Level 5: Overwhelming).

## POLICY STATEMENTS

### 1\. TBRI®-Informed Crisis Prevention

Refuge House prioritizes crisis prevention through trauma-informed relationship building, structured environments, and proactive identification of triggers and warning signs. All staff and foster parents are trained to recognize escalating behaviors using tools such as the Feelings Thermometer and to implement preventive strategies before situations reach crisis level.

### 2\. 24/7 Crisis Response System

Refuge House maintains continuous crisis response capability through its established on-call system staffed by case manager level or above personnel. Crisis Management Staff are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to provide consultation, support, and direct intervention as needed.

### 3\. Service Package-Specific Crisis Response

Crisis response protocols are tailored to meet the specific needs of each T3C Service Package:

- **Basic Foster Family Home Support Services**: Standard crisis response using TBRI® principles and emergency behavior intervention when necessary  
- **Mental & Behavioral Health Support Services**: Enhanced crisis response including mental health crisis recognition, coordination with behavioral health emergency services, and access to Treatment Director consultation  
- **IDD/Autism Spectrum Disorder Support Services**: Specialized crisis response addressing sensory overload, communication barriers, and developmental considerations with access to Registered Nurse consultation

### 4\. Least Restrictive Intervention

Emergency behavior intervention techniques, including personal restraint, are used only as a last resort when less restrictive interventions have been attempted and failed, and only when necessary to prevent harm. Foster parents and staff must first attempt de-escalation strategies including relaxation techniques, quiet time, time out, and verbal interventions.

### 5\. Regulatory Compliance

All crisis response activities comply with applicable regulations including TAC §749.339 (Emergency Behavior Intervention), TAC §749.901 (Emergency Behavior Intervention requirements), TAC §749.1309 (Personal Safety Plans), and T3C Service Package requirements.
