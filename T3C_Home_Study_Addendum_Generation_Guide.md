## 1. WHAT IS A HOME STUDY ADDENDUM

A home study addendum is a formal supplement to an existing foster family home study that documents changes, updates, or additional assessments without requiring a complete rewrite of the original study. In the context of Refuge House's T3C implementation, addenda serve primarily to document the credentialing assessment and approval for additional T3C Service Packages or Add-On Services beyond the initial T3C Basic Foster Family Home credential.

**Key Principle:** The addendum must be able to stand on its own as a credentialing document while referencing the original home study as the foundational assessment. A reviewer (RCCL monitor, SSCC caseworker, or DFPS auditor) should be able to read an addendum and understand the basis for the credentialing decision without needing to read the full home study, though the full home study remains the source of underlying evidence.

**Credentialing Authority:** Per the T3C Blueprint (October 2025, p.12), a credential means a Child Placing Agency, General Residential Operation, or foster home has met the qualifications, as determined by DFPS, to offer a specific Service Package or Add-On Service. DFPS determines credentialing for CPAs and GROs; the individual CPA assesses whether each foster home meets the qualifications to provide the CPA's credentialed services. The home study addendum is the primary vehicle through which the CPA documents this foster-home-level credentialing assessment.

## 2. REGULATORY FOUNDATION

### 2.1 TAC Chapter 749 — Minimum Standards for Child-Placing Agencies

**§749.2803 — What changes affect a foster home's verification?**

Changes that affect a foster home's verification include:

- (a)(1) Marriage, divorce, separation, death, birth, or any other change in household composition
- (a)(2) Change in the foster home's address and/or location
- (a)(3) Change in the foster home's capacity
- (a)(4) Changes in the ages and gender(s) of children for which the home is authorized to provide care
- **(a)(5) Changes in the types of services the foster home will provide** ← Primary regulatory trigger for T3C credential addenda

**§749.2805 — Major life changes requiring screening update**

A foster home screening must be updated if there is a major life change. The update may be completed using an addendum. The update must immediately assess appropriateness of any current placement and be completed within 30 days of notification of the major life change.

**§749.2447 — Foster home screening information requirements**

The original home screening must include comprehensive assessment of the family's ability to provide care. Addenda build on this foundation.

**§749.2449 — Who must be interviewed during screening updates**

At minimum: individual interview with each foster parent, individual interview with each child age 3+ in the home.

**§749.1301–1335 — Home Study Requirements**

Establishes comprehensive content requirements for home studies including background checks, references, medical clearances, financial assessment, home safety inspection, and interview documentation.

**§749.863 — Training Requirements**

Establishes required training hours and content. Package-specific training requirements are layered on top of base training per T3C Blueprint.

**§749.863(c) — Treatment Foster Care Training** (specific to TFFC Package)

Requires specialized training of at least 20 hours for foster parents providing treatment foster care services.

**§749.1351 — Annual Verification Updates**

Requires annual update of foster home verifications, which may incorporate T3C re-credentialing reviews.

**§749.1401–1405 — Kinship Care Provisions**

Addresses verification requirements specific to kinship foster homes, including expedited processes.

### 2.2 T3C Blueprint (October 2025)

**Page 12 — Credential Definition:**
A credential means a CPA, GRO, or foster home has met the qualifications, as determined by DFPS, to offer a specific Service Package or Add-On Service. DFPS determines for CPAs and GROs; the individual CPA assesses whether each foster home meets the qualifications.

**Page 26 — Credential Period:**
CPA credential period is 4 years. Active Interim Credential expires the last day of the 12th calendar month after issuance. Deadline for Interim Credential application: end of December 2025; after that only Full Credential applications accepted.

**Pages 28–30 — Rate Structure and Add-On Eligibility:**

- Only one primary Service Package rate per day of care applied
- Add-On Service rates paid in addition to primary Service Package rate
- **Short-Term Assessment Support Services is NOT eligible for any Add-On Services**
- Add-On Service rates do NOT apply to GRO settings
- Foster Family Home Pass-through Portion of Add-On Service daily rates are still paid to the child's Foster Family Home Caregiver during days taken of Intermittent Alternate Care, but do not have to be paid to the IAC provider

**Page 33 — Credentialing Process:**
CPAs must have a process in place to assess individual foster homes and Foster Family Home Caregivers to provide the CPA's credentialed services.

### 2.3 RCC Contract Requirements

**Contract Term 7** — Establishes provider obligations for home study documentation, credentialing verification, and ongoing compliance monitoring.

### 2.4 Enhancement Requests for Credentialing Application (II.G.1.e)

Governs the process for applying for new credentials including documentation requirements submitted through the Credentialing Platform.

## 11. CRITICAL COMPLIANCE ALERTS

### 11.1 Dual Credentialing — Universal for Enhanced Packages

Every enhanced package (MH, IDD, SU, TFFC) requires BOTH the enhanced credential AND Basic. This enables step-down within the same home — a core T3C design principle. Addendum must verify dual status.

### 11.2 STASS Add-On Exclusion

STASS is categorically ineligible for ANY Add-Ons. AI tools must reject Add-On addendum requests for STASS-only homes.

### 11.3 Substance Use Staffing — LCDC/QCC, Not Licensed Therapist

SU requires LCDC or QCC at 1:13, NOT Licensed Therapist. Treatment Director supervises LCDC/QCC. No BSS/Mentor ratio specified.

### 11.4 TFFC Time Limits

274 days + 91-day extension = 365 max. Step-down planning from Day 1. 60-day continued stay reviews (not 90).

### 11.5 Cost Coverage Commitment

All enhanced packages require CPA to cover costs if STAR Health doesn't. This is a credentialing requirement, not aspirational.

### 11.6 Treatment Model Standard

TFFC: "Research-supported or Evidence-based Treatment Model" (higher standard). All others: "Evidence-informed Treatment Model."

### 11.7 Aftercare — Built into Daily Rate

No separate payment. CPA funds aftercare from daily rate. 6 months mandatory for all enhanced packages and add-ons.

### 11.8 Methodological Rate Summary (October 2025)

| Service/Add-On | Total Daily | CPA Retainage | FFH Pass-Through |
|---------------|------------|---------------|------------------|
| Basic FFH | $83.29 | $42.27 | $41.02 |

| Mental & Behavioral Health | $162.32 | $89.40 | $72.92 |

| IDD/Autism | 4 | Unless sibling group |
| Substance Use | 4 | Unless sibling group |
