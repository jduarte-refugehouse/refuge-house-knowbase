#### (g) Postvention

##### (1) Addressing Suicide Deaths

(A) **Create a Postvention Team and Written Action Plan and Protocols**. To prevent suicide contagion and support employees, children, caregivers, and adoptive parents, you must create a postvention team. This team is responsible for developing a written action plan with protocols in the event of a death by suicide. The postvention team should consider [Medium]:
   - (i) How a death would affect employees, caregivers, adoptive parents, and other children receiving services in the home where the death occurred; and
   - (ii) How to provide psychological first-aid, crisis intervention, and other support to the employees, caregivers, adoptive parents, and other children receiving services in the home where the death occurred.

(B) While the action plan needs to be flexible for varying situations, the **written action plan must include**:
   - (i) A **communication strategy** that [Medium]:
     - (I) Does not inadvertently glamorize or romanticize the child or the death;
     - (II) Occurs in settings that allow the postvention team to monitor responses of individuals in the home;
     - (III) Strives to treat all deaths in the same way (for example, having one approach for honoring a child who dies from cancer, a car accident, or suicide);
     - (IV) Emphasizes the importance of seeking help for anyone with an underlying mental health diagnosis, such as a mood disorder;
     - (V) Emphasizes the importance of employees, caregivers, adoptive parents, and children recognizing the signs of suicide; and
     - (VI) Decreases the stigma associated with seeking help for mental health concerns;
   - (ii) **Mental health resources** for employees, caregivers, adoptive parents, and children who have a difficult time coping, including [Medium]:
     - (I) Opportunities to debrief to process thoughts and feelings related to the suicide death; and
     - (II) Referrals to grief counseling and suicide survivor support groups to the extent possible; and
   - (iii) A **review of lessons learned** from the child's death by suicide. All communications regarding lessons learned should be approached in a way that ensures a blame-free environment. [Medium-High]

##### (2) Addressing Suicide Attempts

In the event of a suicide attempt according to §749.505 of this chapter (relating to What constitutes a suicide attempt by a child?):

- (A) The caregiver must, as needed, **immediately call emergency services** and render first aid until professional medical treatment can be provided [High];
- (B) The caregiver must **not leave the child alone** until a mental health professional assesses the child [High];
- (C) The caregiver must **move all other children out of the immediate area** as soon as possible [Medium];

- (F) The agency must **conduct a review of lessons learned** from the child's suicide attempt. All communications regarding lessons learned should be approached in a way that ensures a blame-free environment. [Medium-High]

> **Technical Assistance**
>
> - Regarding subsection (c)(1)(C) for annual suicide prevention training:
>   - More than likely training on suicide prevention will have to be tailored for each operation because some of the training is based on an operation's own safety planning and the specific screening tool an operation uses to screen for risk. However, related to training on risk factors, protective factors, and warning signs of suicide, one resource that might be helpful is the AS+K? Basic Gatekeeper Training.
>   - An inspector should cite:
>     - §749.939(a)(1) – (4) if the training doesn't meet the instructor-led requirements; and
>     - §749.949 if the training documentation requirements are not met.
> - Regarding subsection (c)(1) suicide prevention training for employees and foster parents and subsection (d)(3) training on the suicide risk screening tool, both types of training may be used to complete the annual training requirements at §749.930 and §749.931.
> - Regarding subsection (c)(3):
>   - Examples of non-employees that may be appropriate for suicide prevention training are non-employees that have routine contact with a child or perform a supervisory role for the child.
>   - You do not have to promote suicide prevention training for foster parents verified to care for children five years of age or older because those foster parents are already required to receive routine suicide prevention training.
>   - Examples of promoting suicide prevention training include sharing your suicide prevention policies and other relevant resources with the appropriate non-employees or encouraging appropriate non-employees to participate in other specific suicide prevention training.
> - Regarding subsection (d)(2), you may use any evidenced-based screening tool that is appropriate for your program. Two screening tools that are free, evidence-based, and have ample research supporting their validity and reliability, are the:
>   - Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS); and
>   - Ask Suicide Screening Questions (ASQ).

### §749.138. What are the general requirements for an agency's policies and procedures?

**Effective Date:** September 2022

(a) The requirements for policies only apply to your policies that are required or governed by this chapter.

(b) All employees and caregivers must be **aware of and follow** your policies and procedures [Medium].

---

### §749.139. What requirements must I follow when adopting my child-placing agency's plans, policies, and procedures?

**Effective Date:** January 2017

(a) Your agency's plans, policies, and procedures must **indicate the date on which you adopted them and their effective date** [Medium-Low].

(b) You must **formalize the adoption** of your agency's plans, policies, and procedures as appropriate for your type of ownership:

1. If you are a **sole proprietor**, you must sign them date [Medium-Low];

2. If you are a **partnership**, each partner must sign them date [Medium-Low]; or

3. If you are a **corporation or other type of business entity**, the governing body must take a written action to adopt (sometimes this may be an order or the adoption may be included in the minutes of the governing body) date [Medium-Low].

---

### §749.141. Can Licensing cite my agency for a deficiency if I fail to operate according to my approved plans, policies, and procedures?

**Effective Date:** January 2017

Yes, if you violate plans, policies, or procedures, then we may cite the relevant standard in Division 1 of this Subchapter (relating to Plans and Policies Required During the Application Process) as a deficiency.

> **Technical Assistance**
>
> - Licensing only enforces plans, policies, and procedures required by the minimum standards. For example, Licensing does not enforce your policies on purchase approvals. In addition, Licensing will not cite this standard if you meet a specific minimum standard but do not meet your policy that requires more than the minimum standard. For example, if your policy requires caregivers to complete 12 hours of general pre-service training and inspection results indicate an employee only completed ten hours of training, we will not cite you for failing to meet your policy.
> - If this Chapter contains another relevant minimum standard, then that standard would be cited for failure to comply with a policy. For example and using the same example as above, if an employee only completed six hours of general pre-service training, we will cite §749.863(a)(1) because the minimum standards require eight hours of general pre-service training. However, if there isn't another relevant minimum standard, then we would cite the relevant standard in Division 1. For example, if your professional staffing plan became outdated, then we would cite §749.105(3).

8. **Prepare the annual budget and control expenditures** and ensure compliance with Division 3 of this Subchapter (relating to General Fiscal Requirements) [Medium].

> **Technical Assistance**
>

For example, Licensing does not enforce your policies on purchase approvals. In addition, Licensing will not cite this standard if you meet a specific minimum standard but do not meet your policy that requires more than the minimum standard. For example, if your policy requires caregivers to complete 12 hours of general pre-service training and inspection results indicate an employee only completed ten hours of training, we will not cite you for failing to meet your policy. But if an employee only completed six hours of training, we will cite you for a deficiency because the minimum standards require eight hours of general pre-service training.
