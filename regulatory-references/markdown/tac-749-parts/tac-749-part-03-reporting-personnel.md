# Chapter 749 - Minimum Standards for Child-Placing Agencies

## Subchapter D - Reports and Record Keeping

### Division 1 - Reporting Serious Incidents and Other Occurrences

#### §749.501 - What do certain terms mean in this subchapter?

**Effective Date:** June 2020

These terms have the following meanings in this subchapter:

1. **Serious incident** - A non-routine occurrence that has or may have dangerous or significant consequences for the care, supervision, or treatment of a child. The different types of serious incidents are noted in §749.503 of this division (relating to When must I report and document a serious incident?).

2. **Triggered review of a child's unauthorized absences** - A review of a specific child's pattern of unauthorized absences when the child has had three unauthorized absences within a 60-day timeframe.

3. **Unauthorized absence** - A child is absent from a foster home without permission from the foster parent, or other temporary caregiver, and cannot be located. This includes when an unauthorized person has removed the child from the foster home.

**Technical Assistance**

Regarding paragraph (3): Child-placing agencies (CPA) should use their best judgment based on the totality of the circumstances on a case by case basis to determine if there is an unauthorized absence. Example 1: if a teenager is routinely late in returning to a foster home from an extracurricular activity, the CPA would likely take the child's routine into account when assessing the possibility of an unauthorized absence. Example 2: If a teenager is on an unsupervised activity and calls and informs the foster parent that he/she will be late in returning to the home, this situation is not likely to be an unauthorized absence.

**Technical Assistance**

• Regarding subsection (a)(2), not every trip to a hospital or emergency clinic must be reported as a serious incident. Only those incidents involving a "substantial physical injury or critical illness" must be reported and documented as a serious incident. The definition of "substantial physical injury" contains some examples of reportable serious incidents. Visits to the emergency room or emergency clinic (that did not result in hospitalization) for a common illness such as the flu, for a chronic illness such as an asthma attack, or for a routine medical exam would not warrant reporting as a serious incident.

• Also, it is the nature of the injury or illness that determines whether it is reportable as a serious incident, not the venue in which it is treated. Taking a child to the emergency clinic or doctor's office for stitches is still reportable as a serious incident, even though the treatment did not occur at an emergency room or hospital.

• Regarding children receiving treatment services for primary medical needs, planned admissions to the hospital are not reportable as serious incidents. If the child sustains a substantial physical injury or contracts a critical illness, a serious incident report is required. However, ongoing treatment for the child's chronic illnesses or conditions is not reportable as a serious incident.

• In addition, admission to a psychiatric hospital only warrants a serious incident report if the admission is precipitated by a reportable incident, such as a suicide attempt. The admission itself is not reportable as a serious incident.

• Regarding paragraph (e)(3), a disaster may be declared by the governor or the presiding officer of the governing body of a political subdivision. The operation or foster home must be located in the area impacted by the declared disaster before paragraph (e)(3) applies.

• Regarding subsection (e)(7), see the Citizen's Guide for the Texas Criminal Justice Process for more information on criminal matters.

#### §749.505 - What constitutes a suicide attempt by a child?

**Effective Date:** September 2010

A suicide attempt is a child's attempt to take his own life using means or methods for causing his death, including any act a child commits intending to cause his death, but excluding suicidal gestures where it is clear that the act was unlikely to cause death. Suicidal thoughts are not reportable as a suicide attempt.

---

#### §749.509 - How do I make a report of a serious incident or occurrence to Licensing?

**Effective Date:** January 2017

(a) All serious incident reports must be made directly to the Texas Abuse and Neglect Hotline [Medium].

(b) Foster parents must report any serious incidents directly to the Texas Abuse and Neglect Hotline if the incident involves a child under the care of the foster parent [Medium].

---

#### §749.511 - How must I document a serious incident?

**Effective Date:** April 2022

A serious incident must be documented in a written report that includes the following information [Medium]:

1. The name of the foster home or adoptive home, physical address, and telephone number [Medium];

2. The time and date of the incident [Medium];

3. The name, age, gender, and date of admission of the child or children involved [Medium];

4. The names of all adults involved and their role in relation to the child(ren) [Medium];

5. The names or other means of identifying witnesses to the incident, if any [Medium];

6. The nature of the incident [Medium];

7. The circumstances surrounding the incident [Medium];

8. Interventions made during and after the incident, such as medical interventions, contacts made, and other follow-up actions [Medium];

9. The treating licensed health-care professional's name, findings, and treatment, if any [Medium];

10. The resolution of the incident [Medium]; and

11. If the child returns to the operation after you complete the report for an unauthorized absence, an update regarding the unauthorized absence and the child's return [Medium].

**Technical Assistance**

• Regarding subsection (3), this requirement is not intended to conflict with confidentiality laws or rights. Identifying information for one child should not be placed in the record of another child. You may choose to:
  1. Write one incident report that is filed centrally (not in each child's record) and de-identified when released as part of a child's record;
  2. Write one incident report that is filed in each child's record, with each copy de-identified to not show the full name of other children involved in the incident; or
  3. Write a separate incident report for each child, with only the first name or initials of each other child involved.

• Regarding subsection (5), witnesses to the incident are persons who were present when the incident occurred and can give a first-hand account of what they experienced during the incident. A person is not automatically a witness because he lives in the same unit or cottage as the child involved in the incident. Witnesses may also be persons unaffiliated with the operation, such as a visitor to the operation who was present at the time of the incident.

#### §749.513 - What additional documentation must I include with a written serious incident report?

---

#### §749.519 - How must I notify parents of a safe sleeping deficiency or an abuse, neglect, or exploitation deficiency?

**Effective Date:** April 2021

(a) Within five days after you receive notification of a deficiency described in §749.517 of this division (relating to What are the notification requirements when Licensing finds my operation deficient in a standard related to safe sleeping or the abuse, neglect, or exploitation of a child in care?), you must notify the parents of each child in the care of each foster home verified by your Child-Placing Agency at the time of notification, including a child who may not have been in care on the day of the actual incident [Medium-High].

(b) When meeting the notice requirements in subsection (a), your main office or a branch office must notify the parents of children in the care of each foster home that the office supervises [Medium-High].

(c) If the deficiency is for a safe sleeping standard, you must notify the parents using Form 2970, Notification of Safe Sleeping Deficiency, located on the Licensing provider website [Medium].

For example, if a child is in the conservatorship of DFPS, **you must notify the child's DFPS caseworker**.

• Regarding paragraph (e), you may maintain the documentation in a manner that is consistent with your policies for record keeping, as long as you can verify that you have notified each parent as required. Possible ways to maintain proof of notification include:
  - Keeping a copy of the notification in each child's individual file;
  - Keeping a single file of all notifications, with a list of the parents whom you notified attached to each notification form; or
  - Maintaining a copy of any notification sent to a parent electronically, including the date and address to which you sent the notification.
