### §749.1137. What if I cannot obtain the required information for an admission assessment?

**Subchapter H, Foster Care Services: Admission and Placement**  
**Division 2, Admission Assessment**  
*January 2007*

(a) You must make reasonable efforts to obtain all required information. [Medium]

(b) If you and the child's parent determine that attempting to get information at the time of placement would not be in the child's best interests, you may postpone attempting to acquire the information. [Medium]

(c) In the child's admission assessment, you must document why a:

   (1) Particular piece of information is unavailable [Medium]; or
   
   (2) Delay obtaining a piece of information is necessary, including efforts made to obtain the information. [Medium]

#### Technical Assistance

Regarding subsection (a), Licensing expects documentation of at least three attempts to comply with a minimum standard requiring "reasonable effort" to obtain information. Efforts should be reasonably spaced, allowing enough time for a person to respond yet not unreasonably delaying the acquisition of the requested information.

**Example:** Calling a CPS caseworker or parent three times in one day would not be considered three separate "reasonable efforts" to obtain needed information, as this does not allow the person reasonable time to respond to each of the requests.

**Example:** Calling a CPS caseworker or parent once every three months to obtain information needed for an admission assessment would not be considered reasonable effort to obtain the information, as the third attempt would be made at least six months after the child was placed.

**Example:** Calling a CPS caseworker or parent once a week for three weeks to obtain information needed for an admission assessment would be considered reasonable effort to obtain the information, as this gives ample time for the person to respond to each call, and also seeks to obtain the information within one month of admission. No further attempts would be expected if the information was not obtained after these three attempts.

## Division 3, Discharge and Transfer Planning

### Technical Assistance

If you suspect the person picking up a child is under the influence of drugs or alcohol, you have the option of contacting local law enforcement to request their assistance.

You may not legally prevent the child from being picked up by a parent or person designated by the parent; however, you have the option of addressing this issue at admission by asking parents what they would like for you to do if you do not feel comfortable releasing the child to one of the parents or their designee and signing an agreement to this effect.

Law enforcement officers and DFPS Child Protective Services staff have the authority by law to remove a child without a parent's permission.

You may want to ask to see identification of persons you do not know.

### §749.1361. What does a "transfer" of a child in care mean?

**Subchapter I, Foster Care Services: Service Planning, Discharge**  
**Division 3, Discharge and Transfer Planning**  
*September 2010*

A transfer refers to a child in care who is moved from one of your programs to another one of your programs operated under the same permit or at the same location. For example, a child may transfer from one foster home in which he was receiving treatment services to another foster home that offers a transitional living program. A child may also transfer from your child-placing agency to your general residential operation, if your child-placing agency office is located on the same property as your general residential operation. This term does not apply if the child experiences a change in programs or services but remains in the same foster home. This term also does not apply if the child moves from one foster home to another for a reason other than a need for different services/programming, such as moving to be closer to siblings.

#### Technical Assistance

A transfer must comply with §§749.1363, 749.1365, and 749.1367. A transfer does not require:
- A discharge summary
- An admission assessment
- A preliminary or initial service plan

See §749.1333 regarding service plan updates related to transfers.

Movement from one foster home to another within the same child-placing agency is only considered a transfer when the primary reason for the move is to provide the child with programmatic or treatment services not offered in the child's current foster home but offered in the foster home to which the child is moving. Moves for other reasons, such as the foster parents deciding to relinquish their verification, are regulated as subsequent placements.
