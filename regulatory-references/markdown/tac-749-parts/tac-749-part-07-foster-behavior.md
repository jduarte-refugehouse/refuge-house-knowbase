(a) The overall agency evaluation is an annual review regarding:

   1. The use and effectiveness of emergency behavior interventions at your agency [Medium]; and

   

   2. Your emergency behavior intervention policies and procedures, including the training policy and curriculum. [Medium]

(b) The objectives of the evaluation are to:

   1. Develop and maintain an environment that supports positive and constructive behaviors of children in care [Medium];

   

   2. Use any type of emergency behavior intervention safely, appropriately, and effectively [Medium]; and

   

   3. Eliminate or reduce physical injuries and any other negative side effects on the child's behavior or emotional development resulting from the emergency behavior interventions. [Medium]

(c) One focus of the evaluation must be on:

   1. The frequency, patterns, and effectiveness of the types of emergency behavior intervention techniques that are used for all children in your foster homes [Medium];

   

   2. Strategies to reduce the need for emergency behavior interventions for all children in your foster homes [Medium]; and

   

   3. Specific strategies to reduce the need for use of specific types of emergency behavior intervention techniques for all children in your foster homes. [Medium]

### §749.2383. What data must be collected?

**Subchapter L, Foster Care Services: Emergency Behavior Intervention**  
**Division 10, Overall Agency Evaluation**  
*April 2022*

(a) Quarterly, you must collect, document, and review aggregate numbers of emergency behavior interventions by type of intervention except for short personal restraints. [Medium]

(b) This information must be reported to us no later than 15 days after the end of each quarter. [Medium]

(c) You must maintain the data for five years. [Medium]

**Technical Assistance**

You must use the provider login section of the HHSC Child Care Regulation web site to report quarterly emergency behavior intervention statistics to Licensing. Please note that you are expected to submit a report even if no emergency behavior interventions were used within your operation during the quarter.

The quarterly data on emergency behavior interventions is due to CCR at the end of each quarter. Since the current minimum standards went into effect on January 2007, this is when the data collection was expected to begin. The quarterly reports are based on this start date. Therefore, quarterly reports should represent the following time frames each calendar year:

- Quarter 1 – January through March

- Quarter 2 – April through June

- Quarter 3 – July through September

- Quarter 4 – October through December
