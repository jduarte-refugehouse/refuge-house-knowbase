# Chapter 749: Minimum Standards for Child Placing Agencies

## Subchapter F: Training and Professional Development

### Division 1: Definitions

#### §749.801. What do certain words and terms mean in this subchapter?

**Subchapter F, Training and Professional Development**  
**Division 1, Definitions**  
*April 2022*

The words and terms used in this subchapter have the following meanings:

1. **CPR** – Cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

2. **Hours** – Clock hours.

3. **Instructor-led training** - Training that is characterized by the communication and interaction that takes place between the student and the instructor. Instructor-led training does not have to be in person, but it must include an opportunity for the student to interact with the instructor to obtain clarifications and information beyond the scope of the training materials. For such an opportunity to exist, the instructor must be able to answer questions, provide feedback on skills practice, provide guidance or information on additional resources, and proactively interact with students. Examples of this type of training include classroom training, online distance learning, blended learning, video-conferencing, or other group learning experiences.

4. **Self-instructional training** - Training designed to be used by one individual working alone and at the individual's own pace to complete lessons or modules. Lessons or modules commonly include questions with clear right and wrong answers. An example of this type of training is web-based training. Self-study training is also a type of self-instructional training.

5. **Self-study training** - Non-standardized training where an individual reads written materials, watches a training video, or listens to a recording to obtain certain knowledge that is required for annual training. Self-study training is limited to three hours of annual training per year, as described in §749.935(d) of this subchapter (relating to What types of hours or instruction can be used to complete the annual training requirements?).

> **Technical Assistance**
>
> Here are two examples to clarify (b)(3): (1) if a person completes a total of 35 hours of pre-service training and is required to complete a total of 18 hours of pre-service training, then that person may only carry over a maximum of 15 of the hours toward the annual training requirements even though the person completed 17 extra hours of non-required, pre-service training; and (2) if a person completes a total of 35 hours of pre-service training and is required to complete a total of 26 hours of pre-service training, then that person may only carry over 9 hours toward the annual training requirements because the person completed 9 extra hours of non-required, pre-service training.
