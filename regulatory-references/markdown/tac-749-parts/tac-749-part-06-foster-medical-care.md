> - Conduct a baseline tuberculosis screening. This screening includes a two-step tuberculosis skin test or a single blood assay for mycobacterium tuberculosis to test for infection with mycobacterium tuberculosis.
> - After the initial baseline screening is conducted and shows negative for tuberculosis, no other testing is required as long as the person continues to live, work, or volunteer in a regulated residential child-care operation.
> - In any of the following circumstances, use a chest radiograph to exclude TB disease:
>   - The person's baseline screening shows positive,
>   - The result shows a mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, or
>   - There is documentation of treatment for latent tuberculosis infection or tuberculosis disease.
>
> Obtain the chest radiograph within a six-month period from the initial baseline screening. Repeat radiographs are not needed unless symptoms or signs of TB disease develop, unless recommended by a physician, or unless the person ceases to live, work, or volunteer in a regulated residential child-care operation for more than 12 months.

(c) Caregivers must maintain the medication record, which must include:
   1. Child's full name [Medium-High];
   2. Prescribing health-care professional's name, if applicable [Medium];
   3. Reason medication was prescribed, for prescription medication [Medium];

(f) You must incorporate the medication record into the child's record. [Medium-Low]

> **Technical Assistance**
>
> **Documenting the time a medication is given:**
>
> For medications with regularly scheduled doses, you may use the regularly scheduled time to document giving the medication as long as it is given within thirty minutes of the scheduled time. Otherwise, you must document the actual time the medication is given.
>
> Example: For a regularly scheduled 9:00 a.m. medication given at 9:20, you may document 9:00 a.m.; if the medication is given at 9:45, then you must document: 9:45 a.m.
>
> If you document the time by initialing the regularly scheduled time (pre-printed on the form), there must be space on the form to document the time given when it is outside the 30-minute window.
>
> For medications that are PRN or one-time only, you must document the exact time the medication is given.
>
> **Documenting the name and signature of the person who administered a medication:**
>
> The purpose of the signature is to be able to identify the person who administered a specific medication to a child, if a concern arises later about that medication. Licensing requires one full signature for each person who administers medication, but there is no need for the person to record a full signature for each dose of medication that he/she administers. Most medication records provide space for a signature and matching initials (usually at the bottom of the page or on the back), then only require a person to use his/her initials to record each time he/she actually gives a dose of medication. Using this system, the initials can be matched to the signature as needed. This complies with minimum standards.

**Division 1, Additional Requirements for Infant Care**  
**April 2021**

You may not lay a swaddled infant down to sleep or to rest on any surface at any time, unless you have an order signed by a health-care professional. You must keep the order in the child's record. [High]

> **Technical Assistance**
>
> There is evidence that swaddling can increase the risk of serious health outcomes, including SIDS and hip disease, and research does not provide definitive data to support the use of swaddling. Even with newborns, research does not provide conclusive data about whether swaddling should be used. Swaddling blankets that become loose during sleep pose an additional risk for infants. For concerns with maintaining an infant's temperature, appropriate clothing and/or a sleeveless infant sleep sack that does not restrict the infant's movement can be utilized. For more information on safe sleep, see the American Academy of Pediatrics Health Initiatives for Safe Sleep and the National Institutes of Health Safe to Sleep Campaign.

## Division 2: Additional Requirements for Toddler Care

### §749.1841. What are the basic care requirements for a toddler?

**Subchapter K, Foster Care Services: Daily Care, Problem Management**  
**Division 2, Additional Requirements for Toddler Care**  
**September 2010**

(a) Each toddler must receive individual attention, including playing, talking, and cuddling. [Medium-High]

(b) A toddler's caregiver must ensure that the environment is safe. For example, free the area of objects that may choke or harm the toddler, take measures to prevent electric shock, free the area of furniture that is in disrepair or unstable, and allow no unsupervised access to water to prevent the risk of drowning. [High]

(c) A toddler's caregiver must never leave the toddler unsupervised. A toddler is considered supervised if the caregiver is within eyesight or hearing range of the child and can intervene as needed, or if the caregiver uses a video camera or an audio monitoring device to monitor the child and is close enough to the child to intervene as needed. [High]

> **Technical Assistance**
>
> Best practice for toddler care suggests:
> - Care given by the same caregiver on a regular basis, when possible;
> - Individual attention given to each toddler including playing, talking, and cuddling; and
> - Holding and comforting a toddler who is upset.
>
> Best practice suggests that furnishings and equipment for toddlers include the following:
> - Age-appropriate seating, tables, and nap or sleep equipment;
> - Enough popular items available so that toddlers are not forced to compete for them; and
> - Make items accessible to toddlers by using containers or low shelving, so the items may be used safely and without direct supervision.
>
> Best practices for nap or rest time include the following:
> - Schedule a supervised sleep or rest period after the noon meal for toddlers according to the child's individual physical needs;
> - Lighting should allow for visual supervision of the toddlers;
> - Limit the sleep or rest period to no more than three hours;
> - Do not force toddlers to sleep and do not put anything in or on a toddler's head or body to force the toddler to rest or sleep;
> - Allow each toddler who is awake after resting or sleeping for one hour to participate in an alternative, quiet activity until the nap/rest time is over for other children who may be resting; and
> - Take a toddler who sleeps or rests in a crib out of the crib for other activities when the toddler awakens.

## Division 6: Discipline and Punishment

### §749.1951. What are the requirements for disciplinary measures?

**Subchapter K, Foster Care Services: Daily Care, Problem Management**  
**Division 6, Discipline and Punishment**  
**January 2007**

(a) Only a caregiver known to and knowledgeable of a child may discipline the child. [Medium]

(b) Each disciplinary measure must:
   1. Be consistent with your policies and procedures [Medium];
   2. Not be physically or emotionally damaging to the child [High];
   3. Be individualized to meet each child's needs [Medium];
   4. Be appropriate to the child's level of understanding, age, and developmental level [Medium-High]; and
   5. Be appropriate to the incident and severity of the behavior demonstrated. [Medium]

(c) The goal of each disciplinary measure must be to teach the child acceptable behavior and self-control. The caregiver must explain the reason for the disciplinary measure when the caregiver imposes the measure. [Medium]

> **Technical Assistance**
>
> It is a good idea for disciplinary measures to be consistent among caregivers. Using positive methods of discipline and guidance encourage self-esteem, self-control, and self-direction. Positive methods of discipline include the following:
>
> - Using praise, positive reinforcement, and encouragement of good behavior instead of focusing only on unacceptable behavior;
> - Reminding a child of behavior expectations daily by using clear, positive statements;
> - Talking with the child about the situation;
> - Focusing on the rule to learn and the reason for the rule;
> - Focusing on solutions that are respectful, reasonable, and related to the problem behavior, rather than blaming or focusing on consequences;
> - Redirecting the child's attention or behavior using positive statements;
> - Providing prior notice of possible consequences for inappropriate behaviors;
> - Giving the child acceptable choices or alternatives;
> - Using brief supervised separation or time away from the group or situation, when appropriate for the child's understanding, age, and development. Best practice suggests that quiet time or time out from the group be limited to no more than one minute per year of the child's chronological or developmental age. However, this time frame may need to be adjusted for some children, such as a child who has attention-deficit disorder. Time out is not appropriate for infants and is not recommended for toddlers, since they are too young to understand this intervention;
> - Arranging the environment to allow safe testing of limits;
> - Using kind but firm action;
> - Giving logical consequences that are appropriate to the situation and severity of the behavior; and
> - Withholding privileges.
