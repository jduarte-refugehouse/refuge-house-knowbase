**Technical Assistance: Children's Nutrition**

Research suggests the following:

- Milk and milk products served to children 12 months old or older should be Grade A pasteurized or from sources approved by the Department of State Health Services.

The following milks do not contain the right amounts of all the nutrients infants need and can harm an infant's health. Iron-fortified infant formula is the best substitute for breast milk. Infants should not be given the following unless recommended by the infant's health-care professional:

- Cow's milk;
- Evaporated cow's milk or home-prepared evaporated cow's milk formula;
- Sweetened condensed milk;
- Goat's milk;
- Soy milk; or
- Imitation milks, including those made from rice or nuts (such as almonds) or nondairy creamer.

(http://www.fns.usda.gov/tn/Resources/feeding_infants.html Feeding Infants: A Guide for Use in the Child Nutrition Programs p.24)

- Milk should be fluid milk.
- Breads and grains should be made from whole-grain or enriched meal or flour.
- Cereal should be whole grain or enriched or fortified.
- Vegetable or fruit juices should be 100% vegetable or fruit juice when used to meet a serving from the vegetable or fruit group.
- Children under one year old should not be offered unpasteurized or raw honey because it may contain spores that pose a health risk.

**Technical Assistance: Food Allergies**

A food allergy is caused by the body's immune system reacting inappropriately to a food or food additive. Symptoms may include wheezing, difficulty breathing, diarrhea, rashes, itching, hives, and headaches. Food allergies are most common in infants, due to their immature digestive systems. Food allergies are usually outgrown during the preschool years. Although any food may cause an allergic reaction, six foods are responsible for most of these reactions in children. These foods are:

- Peanuts;
- Eggs;
- Milk;
- Tree nuts;
- Soy; and
- Wheat.

A child who is pregnant or breastfeeding should avoid consuming peanuts and peanut products due to its association with the development of peanut allergies in infants. It is best not to offer children under two to three years old peanuts or peanut products, such as peanut butter and foods containing or cooked in peanut oil, because of the potential of developing this life-threatening and often life-long allergy. Foods that cause allergic reactions should be eliminated from the diet. However, it is important that the diet still contain a variety of foods for healthy growth and development. A child should receive a medical evaluation if food allergies are suspected. If the child's licensed physician determines that the child has a food allergy, a determination should be made of whether the child's allergic condition meets USDA's definition of disability.

**Food Intolerance**

A food intolerance is an adverse food-induced reaction that does not involve the body's immune system. Lactose intolerance is one example of food intolerance. A person with lactose intolerance lacks an enzyme needed to digest milk sugar. When that person eats milk products, gas, bloating, and abdominal pain may occur. It is best to provide food substitutions for children with food intolerances who cannot consume the regular meal.

Below is a chart from the web site of the Texas Department of Public Safety regarding child passenger safety seat system.

**2013 Child Passenger Safety National Best Practice Recommendations**

| Phase | Type of Restrictive Device | Best Practice Recommendation |
|-------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| Phase 1 | Rear-Facing Seats | Infants: Birth – 35+ pounds, 2+ years old. Rear-facing infant or rear-facing convertible safety seat as long as possible, up to the rear-facing height or weight limit of the seat. Properly install according to instructions in owner's manual, rear-facing in the back seat. |
| Phase 2 | Forward-facing Seats | When children outgrow the rear-facing safety seat (2+ years), they should ride in a forward-facing safety seat as long as possible, up to the upper height or weight limit (40 – 80+ pounds) of the harnesses. Usually 4+ years old. Properly installed forward-facing in the back seat. NEVER turn forward-facing before child meets all: AGE/HEIGHT/WEIGHT requirements set by safety seat manufacturer for forward-facing. |
| Phase 3 | Booster Seats | After age 4 and 40+ pounds, children can ride in a booster seat with the adult lap and shoulder belt until the adult safety belt will fit them properly (usually when the child is 4'9" tall, 10 – 12 years old). MUST have a lap/shoulder belt to use a booster seat. |
| Phase 4 | Adult Safety Belt | Once children outgrow their booster seat (usually at 4'9", 10 – 12 years) they can use the adult lap/shoulder safety belt if it fits them properly. Lap portion low over the hips/tops of thighs and shoulder belt crosses the center of the shoulder and center of the chest. |

Children are better protected the longer they can stay in each phase. Keep children in each seat up to the MAXIMUM age/weight/height limits before moving to the next phase. ALL children younger than age 13 years should ride properly restrained in the back seat.

#### §749.3133. What are the requirements for a swimming pool at a foster home?

**Subchapter O, Foster Homes: Health and Safety Requirements, Environment, Space and Equipment**  
**Division 7, Swimming Pools, Bodies of Water, Safety**  
*April 2022*

(a) The caregivers must inform children about house rules for use of the swimming pool and appropriate safety precautions. Adult supervision and monitoring of safety features must be adequate to protect children younger than 12 years of age and children of any age who are not competent swimmers from unsupervised access to the swimming pool. [High]

(b) The swimming pool must be built and maintained according to the standards of the Texas Department of State Health Services and any other applicable state or local regulations. [Medium-High]

(c) The swimming pool must have a barrier, including a fence or wall, that prevents a child's unauthorized access to the swimming pool. A swimming pool cover does not meet this requirement unless it is a power safety cover that meets the specifications of the American Society for Testing Materials, which specifies safety performance requirements for pool covers. [High]

(d) A fence or wall that is at least four feet high must enclose the pool area. The fence must be well constructed and be installed completely around the pool area. The back wall of a house may serve as one side of the fence or wall as long as the requirements in subsection (f) of this section are met. [High]

(e) Fence gates leading to the outdoor pool area must be self-closing and self-latching. Gates must be locked when the pool is not in use. Keys or locks to open the gate must not be accessible to children under the age of 12 years old, children of any age who are not competent swimmers, or any children receiving treatment services. [High]

(f) If the home serves as one side of the fence or wall, any door that leads from the home to the swimming pool area must have:

1. A door alarm [High]; and
2. A lock that only adults or children over 12 years old can reach. The lock must be completely out of the reach of children younger than 12 years old [High], unless:
   - (A) The state or local fire authority determines that the height of the lock violates or would violate the fire code; and
   - (B) The fire authority's determination is kept in the foster home record.

(g) Furniture, equipment, or large materials must not be close enough to the swimming pool area for a child to use them to gain unauthorized access to the swimming pool. [High]

(h) At least two life-saving devices must be available, such as a reach pole, backboard, buoy, or a safety throw bag with a brightly colored buoyant rope or throw line. One additional life-saving device must be available for each 2,000 square feet of water surface, so a swimming pool of 2,000 square feet would require three life saving devices. [High]

(i) Drain grates must be in place, in good repair, and capable of being removed only with tools. [High]

(j) Caregivers must be able to clearly see all parts of the swimming pool when supervising activity in the area. [High]

(k) The bottom of the swimming pool must be visible at all times. [High]

(l) Swimming pool covers must be completely removed prior to pool use. [High]

(m) An adult must be present who is able to immediately turn off the pump and filtering system when any child is in the swimming pool. [High]

(n) Swimming pool chemicals and pumps must be inaccessible to all children. [Medium-High]

(o) Machinery rooms must be locked to keep children out. [Medium-High]

(p) An above ground swimming pool must:

1. Be inaccessible to children under the age of 12 years old, children of any age who are not competent swimmers, or any children receiving treatment services when it is not in use [High]; and
2. Meet all other requirements in this division. [High]

**Technical Assistance**

Regarding subsection (c), you may review the specifications for pool covers noted by the American Society for Testing Materials at http://www.astm.org/.

Regarding subsection (d), a backyard fence combined with the back wall of a house will meet the intention of the rule; therefore, no additional fence or wall is needed also long as it meets all fence/wall and gate criteria in §749.3133(d) and (f). Subsection (a) requires that children may not have unsupervised access to the pool area. Therefore, if the backyard fence serves as the pool fence/wall, then children may not have unsupervised access to the back yard and doors leading to the back yard must comply with §749.3133(f). If the entire backyard is serving as the pool area, children may not be in the backyard without direct caregiver supervision.

Regarding subsection (p), you must ensure the stairs to an aboveground swimming pool are inaccessible to children.

#### §749.3137. What are the child/adult ratios for swimming activities?

**Subchapter O, Foster Homes: Health and Safety Requirements, Environment, Space and Equipment**  
**Division 7, Swimming Pools, Bodies of Water, Safety**  
*April 2022*

(a) The maximum number of children one adult can supervise during swimming activities is based on the age of the youngest child in the group and is specified in the following chart [Medium-High]:

| If the age of the youngest child is... | Swimming Child/Adult Ratio |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| (1) 0 to 23 months old | 1:1 |
| (2) 2 years old | 2:1 |
| (3) 3 years old | 3:1 |
| (4) 4 years old | 4:1 |
| (5) 5 years old or older in a foster family home; and either:<br>(A) One child is receiving treatment services for primary medical needs; or<br>(B) Three or more children are receiving treatment services | 4:1 |
| (6) 5 years old or older in a foster family home, no children are receiving treatment services for primary medical needs, and no more than two children are receiving treatment services | 6:1 |

(b) When all of the children in the group are at least four years of age or older, in addition to meeting the required swimming child/adult ratio listed in subsection (a) of this section, at least two adults must supervise four or more children who are actually in the water. [High]

(c) When a child who is non-ambulatory or who is subject to seizures is engaged in swimming activities, you must assign one adult to that one child. This adult must be in addition to any lifeguard on duty in the swimming area. You do not have to meet this requirement if a licensed physician writes orders in which the physician determines that the child [High]:

1. Is at low risk of seizures and that special precautions are not needed; or
2. Only needs to wear a Coast Guard approved life jacket while swimming and additional special precautions are not needed.

(d) A lifeguard who is supervising the area where the children are swimming may be counted in the child/adult ratio; however, one caregiver must always be present and the lifeguard may not be the only person counted in the child/adult ratio.

(e) A child must wear a Coast Guard approved life jacket while participating in swimming activities in other bodies of water, such as ponds, rivers, lakes, and oceans, if the child is:

1. Under the age of 12 [High]; or
2. Unable to swim, regardless of the child's age. [High]

(f) The ratios in subsection (a) of this section:

1. do not include children over the age of 12 years old who are competent swimmers.
2. Are not required when children are participating in water activities such as sprinkler play or splash/wading pool, as long as the standing water is less than two feet.

**Technical Assistance**

Regarding subsection (b), if a foster parent takes four 4-year-olds swimming, subsection (a) only requires one person to supervise the four children. However, if all four 4-year-olds are in the water at the same time, then subsection (b) requires there to be at least two adults to supervise the children.

**Subchapter O, Foster Homes: Health and Safety Requirements, Environment, Space and Equipment**  
**Division 7, Swimming Pools, Bodies of Water, Safety**  
*January 2017*

Yes, a foster parent using the "reasonable and prudent parent standard" as defined in §749.2605 of this title (relating to What is the "reasonable and prudent parent standard"?) may approve a child to participate in unsupervised childhood activities (activities away from the foster home and the foster parents) involving swimming that do not comply with the rules of this Division of this subchapter (relating to Swimming Pools, Bodies of Water, Safety). However, depending upon the background of the child (for example the child's age, level of maturity and responsibility, and proficiency in swimming), such an approval may or may not require limitations like other adult supervision or the need for a life jacket when boating.
