**Subchapter M, Foster Homes: Screenings and Verifications**  
**Division 1, General Requirements**

(a) You may verify only one spouse if:

   (1) The spouse whom you verify will be the only one involved in the care of any foster child in the home;

   (2) The spouses have been living apart for at least two years; and

   (3) After interviewing the spouse living outside of the foster home as part of the screening process, you determine that the spouse will not:

      (A) Have unsupervised access to foster children, as "unsupervised access" is defined in §745.601 of this title (relating to What words must I know to understand this subchapter); or

      (B) Regularly or frequently be present at the foster home, as defined in §745.601 of this title.

(b) If the requirements in subsection (a) of this section are not met, you must verify both spouses to provide foster care. **[Medium-High]**

(c) If at any time the requirements in subsection (a) are no longer being met, the change in circumstances:

   (1) Is considered a "major life change in the foster family";

#### Technical Assistance

However, you are responsible for submitting a background check request for the spouse if the spouse requires one under §745.605.

- For subsection (c), in addition to the requirements noted here for a "major life change in the foster family" there are other requirements that a foster family and a child placing agency must follow, including:
  - A foster home must notify a child-placing agency of any "major life change in the foster family," see §749.2655;

| If the home cares for: | Then the maximum number of children the home may care for is: |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Infants | Six, with a maximum of two infants and two more children less than six years old, unless the placement is necessary to maintain a sibling group of children. **[Medium-High]** |
| One child or more receiving treatment services for primary medical needs | • Six, with a maximum of three children with primary medical needs requiring total care, unless the placement is necessary to maintain a sibling group of children. **[Medium-High]**<br>• Four, if all placements are children with primary medical needs requiring total care, unless the placement is necessary to maintain a sibling group of children. **[Medium-High]**<br>• Foster family homes verified to provide treatment services to children with primary medical needs before January 1, 2015, may continue to care for up to six children with no limitation. **[Medium-High]** |

(b) A one-parent foster family home with one additional full-time, live-in caregiver or a two-parent foster family home may care for seven or eight children if all of the following criteria are met **[Medium-High]**:

   (1) Each foster or adoptive child that you place in the home that expands the home's capacity to more than six children is placed in the home for the purpose of allowing:

      (A) Siblings to remain together;

      (B) A child with an established meaningful relationship with the foster family (including a relative or close family friend) to remain with the family;

      (C) A parenting youth in care to remain with the child of the parenting youth; or

      (D) A family with special training or skills to provide care to a child who has a severe disability;

   (4) You complete a Foster Family Home Capacity Exception Form with the appropriate signatures and place the form in the foster family home record; and

   (5) After you complete the exception form, you lower the home's capacity each time a child listed on the form leaves the home until the home's capacity does not exceed six. This applies to both a foster child that leaves and a child who was placed in the home to be adopted leaves without the adoption being consummated.

(c) A one-parent foster family home or two-parent foster family home with one foster parent absent for extended periods of time (such as military service or out-of-town job assignments) may care for up to six children, except as noted in the chart below **[Medium-High]**:

| If the home cares for: | Then the maximum number of children the home may care for is: |

(d) Notwithstanding subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section, a child-placing agency may request an exception for a foster family home to care for seven or eight children by using the process for requesting a variance that is in 26 TAC Chapter 745, Subchapter J of this title (relating to Waivers and Variances for Minimum Standards) and meeting the requirements of that subchapter. When processing a request for a variance related to a foster home's capacity, we will consider any limitations in state or federal law.

(e) The maximum number of children that a foster family home may care for includes any biological and adopted children of the caregivers who live in the foster home, any children receiving foster or respite child-care, and any children for whom the family provides day care. All adults in care must also be counted in the capacity of the home as required by §749.2651(b) of this title (relating to May a foster home accept adults into the home for care?). **[Medium-High]**

#### Technical Assistance

- In addition to the requirements in 749.2551(b), foster homes with a capacity of more than six children must continue to meet the other minimum standards that relate to foster homes, or a variance must be requested and approved, as appropriate, including:
  - The capacity must be consistent with the requirements for determining capacity at §749.2555 (How do I determine capacity?);
  - The foster home screening must be updated as required by §749.2453 (When must I update the foster home screening?);
  - The foster home's verification certificate must be amended with the increased capacity as required by §749.2481 (What type of certificate must a foster home have in order to prove verification?); and
  - The foster home's capacity must be updated on Licensing's public website as required by §749.2489 (What information must I submit to Licensing about a foster home's verification status?).

- Here is an example to clarify paragraph 749.2551(b)(5): A foster family home is currently licensed for a total capacity of six children. Currently, the home has no biological children and four foster children. A CPA then determines it is appropriate to increase the foster family home's capacity to eight to take in a sibling group of four. If one of the current foster children leaves the home's care, then the CPA must reduce the capacity of the foster family home down to seven children.
