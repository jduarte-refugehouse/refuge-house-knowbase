- Examples: `T3C Basic Foster Family Home Support Services Policy.md`, `Admission Assessment Policy.md`
- **Consistency:** ✅ Generally consistent

**Procedures:**
- Format: `[Procedure Name] Procedure.md`
- Examples: `Admission Assessment Procedure.md`, `Individual Service Planning Procedure.md`
- **Consistency:** ✅ Generally consistent

**Policy Numbers:**
- **T3C Umbrella:** FC-T3C-01 ✅
- **Functional Areas:** FC[number]-01 (e.g., FC2-01, FC3-01, FC14-01) ✅
- **Package-Specific:** FC-[PACKAGE]-01 (e.g., FC-MH-01, FC-IDD-01) ✅
- **Add-Ons:** FC-[ADDON]-01 (e.g., FC-KIN-01) ✅

- Some variations: FC-16.1, FC-17.1, FC10-01.2 ⚠️ (Minor inconsistencies)

#### Recommendations

1. **Standardize Policy Number Prefixes** (Optional)
   - Consider: All use FC-##-01 format (e.g., FC-02-01 instead of FC2-01)
   - **Impact:** Low - Current system works well
   - **Priority:** Low

2. **File Name Alignment** (Optional)
   - Consider: Include policy numbers in filenames (e.g., `FC2-01 Admission Assessment Policy.md`)
   - **Impact:** Medium - Would improve searchability
   - **Priority:** Medium

3. **Package-Specific Naming** (Optional)
   - Consider: Consistent format (e.g., `FC-MH-01 Mental & Behavioral Health Support Services Policy.md`)
