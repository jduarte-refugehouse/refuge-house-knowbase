## POSITION SUMMARY

This job description reflects the flexible, specialized nature of case management within the T3C service delivery model. Responsibilities will be tailored to individual caseload composition, with appropriate training and support provided for all specialized functions.

**This is an in-person position requiring consistent office presence when not conducting field-based case management activities. The clinical nature of child welfare services, the interdisciplinary treatment team approach required by T3C Service Packages, and the immediate access needs for supervision and crisis coordination make this role unsuitable for remote work arrangements.**

**Success in this position requires strong collaboration skills, effective time management to balance field and office responsibilities, commitment to trauma-informed practice, and dedication to working as part of an integrated clinical team to achieve positive outcomes for vulnerable children and families.**
